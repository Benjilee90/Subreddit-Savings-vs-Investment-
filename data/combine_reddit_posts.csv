1,k4tihv,Everything is Negotiable,"Throughout my time working at a New York based Private Equity firm, the angriest my boss (one of the Managing Partners at the firm) ever got at me had nothing to do with my job performance. Instead, he was disappointed with the steep rent price I was paying for my NYC studio. I explained to him it was the cheapest option within walking distance of the office. He immediately questioned me, “Did you negotiate the price?” I shook my head no. He responded with three words that have forever changed my perception, “Everything is negotiable”, then walked away.

I know he did not invent this quote, I had heard it before. However, I always attached “Everything is negotiable” to a used car salesman or Antique Roadshow, thinking it was just a corny sales line more than anything else. It was not until my Managing Partner, someone whom I deeply respect, recited this quote to me that I took it heart, and began to really analyze why “Everything is negotiable”.

**Why is “Everything is negotiable”**

The main reason “everything is negotiable” is because marketplaces are inherently inefficient. In a marketplace where a product is priced to maximize profits, a company forgoes potential profits on customers who are only willing to buy the product for a cheaper price. For example, picture the following conditions for a T-shirt company:

Cost of T-Shirt Production: $9.00

Number of Customers if T-Shirt Price is $20.00= 20 customers

Number of Customers if T-Shirt price is $10.00= 30 customers.

In this scenario, the T-shirt company company will make a larger profit listing its T-shirts for $20.00 ($220.00 profit), than $10.00 ($30.00 profit), and thus list the shirt for $20.00.

However, if the T-shirt company could *price discriminate* (charge different prices to different people based on their demand for the product), they would sell their T-shirts for $20.00 to the 20 customers ($11.00 profit per customer), then sell 10 shirts for $10.00 to the customers who are only willing to pay $10.00 for the shirt ($1.00 profit per customer). When price discriminating, as long as the company is making a profit (total revenue&gt; total cost), it always makes sense to sell a t-shirt at the price.

**Use Negotiation to Allow Price Discrimination:**

Two examples of price discrimination are age-based discounts (Senior Citizen or Children discounts) and time of week price cuts (gas stations will cut prices on specific week days, where only price sensitive customers will realize the discount). However, as you can likely tell, the problem with price discrimination is it's almost impossible to market. Both these examples capture some price discrimination, but do not come close to fully realizing potential discrimination. Thus, most companies will not price discriminate their products, and will find a single price that optimizes their profits.

The moral of the story is that companies *want* to price discriminate, but they are *unable* to. However, through effective negotiation, we (the customer) are able to expose the minimum price a company will be able to sell a product at. While in reality it is likely impossible to try to negotiate “everything” (I do not think you are going to be able to negotiate the price of a bag of Cheetos at a Walmart), there are many products you can negotiate which you may not have known are possible.

A few examples:

1. Hotel/ AirBnB prices: If a hotel is in off-season, or simply has excess rooms, they will likely be able to give you a discount. This is especially apparent during COVID, where the hospitality industry has been struggling. At the very least, you may be able to get some added benefit or a better room for the same price.
2. Media Subscriptions: Subscription based media companies (Netflix, Xfinity etc.) often charge a monthly postpay. However, they would prefer their users to prepay an annual subscription, as it guarantees customer retention and increases their cash flow immediately (to reinvest into the company). Thus, media providers will often provide a significant discount if you are willing to commit to an annual prepayment. The best part: you do NOT even have to negotiate. Third party platforms like Ubund will negotiate a 30%+ discount to your media subscription **for you** if you commit to a 1 or 2 year prepayment.
3. Furniture: Furniture showroom price is often much higher than its manufactured price. It is always worth attempting to negotiate on furniture before you purchase.
4. Gym Memberships
5. Electronics
6. Medical Bills

Tip for Negotiation: Increase Your Bargaining Power

Before you negotiate, always do your research to figure out how you can incentivize the seller to sell to you for less. Bullet 2 above is a great example of using research to increase bargaining power. These third party negotiation platforms understand that media companies prefer being paid upfront for a longer commitment, so they leverage the preference for an added discount for their customers. You can apply a similar negotiation tactic to anything you want a discount on. If you want a discount on a long-term stay on an Airbnb, explain to the Airbnb owner the benefits of your long term commitment (increased customer retention), then tell the owner you will only stay for an additional discount. Even if you do not have a bargaining angle, use the power of time. Tell the furniture salesperson that a couch you want is slightly over budget, but you are willing to purchase it immediately if provided a reasonable discount. Even if a negotiation attempt does not work, you will see over time that “negotiating everything” will consistently save you money.

So why increasing your credit score should save you money? Well, having a better credit score will allow you to access more financing options at much better terms. For example, with FHA loans the down payment required varies in function of your credit score: the higher the credit score, the lower the down payment you will have to make and the lower the interest rates you will be charged (because you will be seen as a ""good borrower""). The capital that you won't have to put toward the down payment can be invested and grown and the smaller interest rate will save you quite a bit of money in the long run.

[I have made a short video]( where I explain how to improve your credit score, as well as going through the different type of loans and their credit score requirements. If you want to understand this better, build real savings for your future self and get educated on a smart way to save money then the video is definitely worth a watch.

1,k109nz,Saving on Software,"  As the holiday season comes closer, that need for cash is greater than ever. Whether it's getting the right gift for a loved one, or preparing for your COVID conscious gathering, money can feel especially tight, and making sure you budget correctly is more important than ever.  


   When we try to think of ways we can save, most of us go through the same list of ways we can cut spending on non-essentials. For example, going out to eat less, drinking less or cheaper alcohol, turning off the heat and lowering utilities are all ways people change their lifestyle to save money. While cutting out non-essentials is a great habit to practice, I believe there is a better way to save money (without changing your lifestyle) that is often overlooked.  


   Saving on software. When people think to save, they rarely think of saving through software, and when they do, they think of cancelling their subscriptions. However, one can easily save on almost all software companies by using their bargaining power and prepaying. Today, almost all consumer oriented software companies (SaaS) will provide a monthly subscription option. While this option provides little commitment to the user, over time a monthly subscription will be more expensive than paying annually. This is because for software companies, cash now is always better than future cash (they can reinvest in the business and it guarantees customer retention). Therefore, unless you plan on only using a software for only a few months, it makes sense to prepay annually for your subscription.  


   How can you prepay annually? First, many software companies understand the power of annual prepayment, and will offer a flex option of the ability to subscribe monthly for one price or annually for a significant discount. However, what if the company only provides a monthly subscription (etc. Netflix, Xfinity)? There are third party platforms like [Ubund]( which will leverage annual prepayment for you. Simply pay through the third party platform, and they will immediately provide you with a 30%+ discount for your prepayment. These third party platforms make money by acting as an added marketing source for softwares, so they do not cost you more than going through the software company themself.  


   Saving money has never been easy and never will be easy. Almost always one has to change their lifestyle negatively in order to stay. However, prepaying for software is one of the few ways one can save without changing their lifestyle at all! So go through those subscriptions, figure out how to annually prepay for them, and get a loved one something nice with the extra cash you have.",3,440,software,holiday season come closer need cash greater ever whether getting right gift loved one preparing covid conscious gathering money feel especially tight making sure budget correctly important ever try think way u go list way cut spending non essential example going eat le drinking le cheaper alcohol turning heat lowering utility way people change lifestyle money cutting non essential great habit practice believe better way money without changing lifestyle often overlooked software people think rarely think software think cancelling subscription however one easily almost software company using bargaining power prepaying today almost consumer oriented software company saas provide monthly subscription option option provides little commitment user time monthly subscription expensive paying annually software company cash always better future cash reinvest business guarantee customer retention therefore unless plan using software month make sense prepay annually subscription prepay annually first many software company understand power annual prepayment offer flex option ability subscribe monthly one price annually significant discount however company provides monthly subscription etc netflix xfinity third party platform like ubund leverage annual prepayment simply pay third party platform immediately provide discount prepayment third party platform make money acting added marketing source software cost going software company themself money never easy never easy almost always one change lifestyle negatively order stay however prepaying software one way one without changing lifestyle go subscription figure annually prepay get loved one something nice extra cash

1,jxvoop,How to Save Money to Have More Money to Spend,"I love saving money. Why? I love saving money, so, that I can spend money. Yeah- I know that doesn’t make much sense, but, it is the absolute truth. There are many people who talk about how to live minimally and spend no money – that is not me. By the time I was ten I knew there were things in life I wanted – a house, a cottage and a sports car. That list has grown and evolved every year since. I could tell you that I don’t care about nice cars, or clothes, jewelry etc., but, I would be lying. I love nice stuff. It is not that I intentionally try to find expensive things to buy, it just seems to work out that way.

When I was growing up we did not have a lot of money. My parents worked hard and taught my Brother and Sister and I how to save and live within our means. Our first big lesson was: do not buy things you cannot afford. For a person who loves expensive stuff this was not a fun lesson, but, it is one I learned. We were told that if you cannot pay for it then you can’t have it. As a teenager I came to a quick realization – I needed to save where I could in order to get the things that I really want.

My saving strategy has never been to cut out things for a short period of time in order to save money. It is more about saving money daily in any way that I can. Since COVID I found saving money to be even easier than in the past. This article is going to focus on saving money by reducing the costs of the things you use every day (particularly if you are working from home due to COVID).

## How to Save Money

1. Use toll highways as seldom as possible and if you must use one make sure you have a transponder. In Ontario the cost to use the 407 ETR for 24 kilometers is $11.74 one way with a transponder and $15.94 without. If you are a toll road user and have started working remotely your savings per month would be $469.60 for transponder users.
2. Save your gas money. If you are now working at home, bank your gas money. This can create up to an additional $200.00 per month.
3. Make your coffee at home. If you skip your morning coffee out you can save an additional $40.00 per month.
4. Reach out to your Insurance company and request a reduction in your car insurance.
5. Do your laundry in off-peak hours which is 7:00-pm-7:00 am.
6. Try lowering your cell-phone charges.
7. Designate no spend days (you would be amazed how quickly the money adds up).
8. Make and stick to a grocery list.
9. Use coupons whenever you can.
10. Sign up for loyalty programs at all of the places you do business.
11. Do not buy books- borrow them from the library.
12. Save all of your change in a jar and do not touch it until the jar is full. Once it is full, roll your change and take it to the bank.
13. Do not pay any bank charges – switch to a bank with no fee accounts.
14. Use a programmable thermostat.
15. Turn off the tap when you are brushing your teeth.
16. Learn how to cook! If you rely on take out learning how to cook is a must.
17. Create a budget. It is important for you to know what your cost of living is. This is very important to know.
18. Work at paying off any high interest debt.
19. Consolidate your debt for a lower interest fee.
20. Get rid of cable (if you love cable request a lower package from your service provider.

If you do these 20 things you will be amazed at how quickly your savings will grow.

1,jr28el,An Intro to Emergency Funds,"Did you know that 60% of millennials cannot cover a $400 emergency!? For a nation riddled with debt, it is sad to see how many do not have an emergency fund. What is an emergency fund? It's a set amount of money you put aside with the sole purpose of bailing you out when s\*it hits the fan. And as you know, s\*it will always hit the fan. So why do so many people who know what the emergency fund is not have one? I think it's because many don't know where to start in creating one. I'm going to summarize some of the posts I've written to help anyone out there start building their emergency fund. For starters, your emergency fund should be between 3-6 months worth of expenses. I feel this should fluctuate based on your job, if you have a stable line of work then closer to 3 is probably good. If you are a freelancer and in and out of work, then 6 or more months is best for you. I certainly wouldn't go with less than 3. I know Dave Ramsey has people start with $1000, and I don't want to disagree with Dave but I have had two different instances with over $1000 emergencies. So how do you go about building your fund once you have a goal total in mind?

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you don't have an emergency fund then you need to get on a budget, or as I call it, a spending plan. This is the only way to free up money in order to start allocating it toward your goals. A real easy way to start saving money is to pay yourself first buy setting up automatic monthly transfers to your savings account. You simply determine how much you want to send to your savings account each month and make it a recurring payment. I have a [step by step guide here]( for more information
2. It's smart to have your emergency fund completely separate from your checking account, as in you can't use a debit card to spend it. Most high-yield online banks allow simultaneous transfer of funds, so if an emergency comes up it takes only a few seconds to transfer the money. In addition, storing your fund at a high-yield savings account will earn you some extra interest.  [Here is an introduction]( to high-yield savings accounts for those interested.
3. You should know that emergencies happen even when building this fund. Do not get discouraged, if you have to dip into it then you continue on building it. With each dip into this fund you will be more thankful that you had it in the first place. My first $700 car emergency was the eye-opening experience I needed to understand how crucial always having this fund was. 
4. Know that it will take time to achieve your goal, but in the process you are also developing the habits required to build wealth. Once you have started tracking your spending to properly fund this account, you can now use those behaviors for other goals. Let's say that through budgeting you've been putting $200 per month to build your emergency fund. Once that fund is at your goal you now have that same $200 to put to a new goal. You've developed the skills and behaviors necessary to start building a true nest egg!

Hopefully these tips help inspire some of you to start building your emergency fund today. [Here is the original post]( where most of this was taken from.  

I greatly enjoy helping people with their finances, and continue to enjoy the conversations that happen in this community about budgeting.

For as long as I can remember, I have lived paycheck to paycheck and then some. My credit card of about $1000 was maxed out way more often than it should have been, and I didn't really save.

For the past couple of months I've been putting aside some money, but only reducing costs reactively. It's been fun, but a real pain, easy to trick and hard to keep track of.

So now I've created one bank account for every expense I have (19 to be exact) and set up automatic fund transfers at pay day. Grocery money enters another account (grocery buffer), before being transferred to the grocery account every single day. (No more accidental over spending!)

I've also set up monthly transfers to an emergency fund, and to a car savings account!

I should have a surplus of 18% after everything is paid, which for the first month will cover bills I'm behind on and can be saved after that month.

1,jmuqfr,Savings: Tips for Broke College Students (Like Me),"College is not cheap. Even after tuition payments, student loans, room and board and a meal plan, there are still many expenses for college students which add up over time. As a college student, despite prepaying for all of those expenses, I still always found myself spending significantly more than I budgeted for (unexpected take-out, various media subscriptions, deceivingly expensive textbook, alcohol etc.). By the end of all these expenses, I found myself virtually broke, with no money to spend on things I *truly* wanted at the time. 

While the easiest way to save more is to limit some of the impulsive spending I mentioned, I understand first hand as a college student that cutting impulse spending is extremely difficult. Oftentimes, when I try to actively cut out impulse purchases, I find myself giving in to a Doordash order (or equivalent) 3-4 days later. Simply put, impulse spending is something we enjoy as college students and makes us happy. Therefore, instead of trying to tell you to stop buying what you like, below are a few tips that will help you save money without cutting out the things you enjoy.

1. **Buy used books and resell**: Never buy brand new textbooks and never rent textbooks. Instead, buy the cheapest decent quality used textbook, keep it in good condition, and resell it once your semester ends. There are many textbook resell websites anyone can post on  (I cannot hyperlink on this page, but simply google “textbook resell websites”), or you can just resell the book to a college friend.  If you do your research, you can often make money through textbook arbitrage (reselling the textbook for more than you pay for it). 
2. **Get a time flexible job (Doordash/Uber):** Between class, studying, and extracurriculars, it can often be very difficult to find consistent time to work during school. However, for those who do have the occasional free time, working a time flexible job like Doordash or Uber is a great way to earn a couple of bucks quick. For Doordash (or an equivalent), you do not even need a car. Just bring your old bike from home up to school (or buy a used bike for cheap) and start delivering. Colleges have some of the highest demand for food delivery, so there will be no shortage of work and it can also double as a great workout.
3. **Prepay your subscriptions for a discount**: Whether it is your Netflix and Xfinity accounts, or even your online class subscription, find a way to prepay your subscription annually for an additional discount. Most companies will give a significant discount (30%+) if you commit to prepay for 1 or 2 years. If your desired subscription does not have a prepay option, there are third party platforms available that will prepay annually for you (and you will receive the same discount). 
4. **Passively Invest:** You do not need to be Warren Buffet or Ray Dalio to succeed in the market. In fact, you do not even need to know a thing about the markets, just invest in the market as a **whole**. Since the 1920s, the S&amp;P has averaged an annualized return of 10%. Compare this to your savings account which grows 1-2% or less a year, and the answer is obvious. Simply open a commission free brokerage account (like Robinhood), invest in an S&amp;P index fund (or equivalent), and increase your savings significantly.

1,jkzug0,Moneybox app? Anyone with experience? Is it actually worth using? Heard good things and read some not so good things.,"Hi all, I just had a question about the money box app. The one where it rounds up the change from every purchase to the nearest pound and saves it for you.

I was just wondering if anyone has used it before and if anyone had any advice on how useful it is. I’ve seen some complaints about how long you need to wait to withdraw the money from your savings (45-90 days depending on interest rate) but that doesn’t bother me too much, considering that I shouldn’t ever be too desperate to whack it into my NatWest savings account.

1,jjr8qb,Tips for saving money when ordering online,"Hi r/SavingMoney,

\- look for special offers/promos/coupons: social media &amp; Google Search is your friend

\- sign up for a monthly pass: might be worth it if you order a lot

\- order more (&amp; share): order for more meals/people to share the fees

1,jiiixa,The Real Way to Budget,"Something I have always struggled with is budgeting. While after every paycheck I track how much money I spend on each expense (and think by doing so that I am budgeting and saving), I always feel myself short on cash and spending less at the end of each pay period. This habit I have created is because I am not *budgeting*, but I am *expense tracking.* 

Expense tracking is the act of noting every expense one incurs over a period of time and evaluating it based on your total savings. While expense tracking is a great way to determine how much of your savings have been allocated to certain expenses, it gives no projection of how to allocate your budget for **future** expenses. Through expense tracking, one is unable to properly weigh how they want to allocate their cash and savings over a period of time.

Expense tracking leads to short term lifestyle inflation, or the tendency to increase spending when their income increases. A personal example of lifestyle inflation is my relationship with food. Whenever I receive a paycheck (and my bank account seems bigger), my drive to cook seemingly decreases, and I begin to order take out significantly more than usual. A week and a half later, I will track my expenses, feel worse about my savings, and you will find me eating 89 cent canned chicken for 2 meals a day. While this tactic of expense tracking and momentary lifestyle inflation is one way of living life, most of us can agree that it is not our *ideal* lifestyle.

The key to living a consistent and well-balanced lifestyle is to budget. Successfully budgeting is to list out all of your future expenses at the beginning of each year, month, and even week. By budgeting, you can get a clearer picture of how much of your savings you are willing to allocate towards a variety of expenses (or investing). Instead of ordering take out 5 times in a row, and then eating cheaply and unhealthily for 2 weeks, budgeting allows me to spread out my take out days, and allows me to manage how I want to allocate spending on take-out and home cooked meals versus all other expenses. While budgeting may prevent you from experiencing the short-term euphoria of lifestyle inflation, in the long-term, budgeting will breed a more financially stable and ultimately happier lifestyle.

While budgeting is a necessity, it is not easy. Knowing just how much to spend in each expense category is extremely difficult and takes time to master. However, it is possible. Here are some tips I have to increase your spend predictability and to budget effectively.

1. Use a budgeting app: There are many budgeting apps which can help you list out your expenses and provide tips as to how to allocate your savings most efficiently.
2. Subscribe: Using monthly-subscription based services is a great way to predict your expenses. Whether it is a subscription meal box or a streaming app, subscriptions in any expense category give a clear picture of how much of your savings need to be allocated towards a particular expense. (To save money on subscriptions, I recommend you subscribe annually to all your subscriptions, or use a third party platform which will offer you an added discount for committing to prepaying a subscription annually).
3. Invest to Save: When budgeting, people often believe savings entails leaving a particular portion of their budget in a savings account (and earning 1-2% interest annually). By investing safely in index funds, mutual funds, or ETFs (which all require very little investing knowledge to use), anyone can easily earn 10%+ on their savings a year. Through investing, your budget will slowly begin to look bigger and bigger.

1,j83h10,Any thoughts? I could use some advice,"Guys, I need your help. Do you try to follow the news? Have you run into issues trying to get news from different sources but found yourself spending too much on subscriptions? Let me tell you about what I have experienced. 

I am a college student who is trying to stay engaged with what is going on in the world, while also juggling many other expenses. I constantly hear that regardless of the profession I choose, being current on world events is very important. However, what I do not hear is advice on the best ways to accomplish this vague task. 

After diving in headfirst, inspired and motivated by the challenge posed to me, I started signing up and subscribing to all the news that I could. At first, I found little issues, as many places offer free trials, while some of the poorer sources are able to disguise their lackluster content for a time. I was a happy camper consuming news, with little cost (other than my free time!). 

As they say, “all good things must come to an end”. This was the case for me being able to have access to all the news I want without it hurting my financially vulnerable position. After my trial periods were up, these media outlets were asking me for all kinds of money that I was unable to pay. 

My initial thought was to try to find out what I could afford. After a little bit of digging, I realized that I could hardly even afford access to one high-quality media source (I decided, and still believe, that it is most important to consume quality media, and not misinformed, lackluster journalism). 

My financial constraints posed the problem that I was initially worried about – only hearing one angle of the issue/story. It is very important to be able to form your own opinions, and this simply does not happen by only consuming the news from one source. I was at a real crossroads. 

Lucky for me, I learned about a site that could help me manage and keep track of my subscriptions. This site uses a proprietary strategy to manage its users’ subscriptions. It was able to decrease what I was paying for my news by over 30%! This was a real game changer for me. Ultimately, because of this site, I am far more financially equipped to pursue the challenge/necessity of being a well-read aspiring professional by keeping up with current events. 

To learn more about the site that is saving me money: [](

1,j7oz3x,The Never Ending Gym Subscription: How I lost money through Negligence (and How to Prevent It),"If you're anything like me, you likely hate looking through any type of contract. To be honest, I do not think I have ever looked through a single “Terms and Conditions” agreement. While I assume most of you are the same as me in this regard, my tendency to both overlook the finer details in contracts and overlook payments in my bank account history has cost me hundreds of dollars. While I will give my solution to breaking this habit later, here is an example of how I lost money through negligence.

**The Never Ending Gym Membership:**

In the summer of 2019, I was interning in Boston and signed up for a two month student deal the gym was offering. Well, at least I thought it was two months. When I signed up, I mentioned to the front desk worker that I wanted the membership for only two months. When he nodded in response, I assumed I had signed up for the correct plan, and the membership never again crossed my mind for months.

Fast-forward to October, I am in my dorm and after a night of too much spending, I check my bank account to check the damage. Below my spending from that night, I see a $50.00 October charge from the gym I used in the summer. I keep looking and see another charge for September as well. I immediately call to cancel my subscription and nobody picks up. Within the course of the next few days, I email and call 20 different people within the company. Every person I spoke with assures me my membership is canceled but that they will “follow up with their superior” about a refund. For days I try as hard as I can to reach a “superior” and never get a response...I was not going to get the refund. But not only was I not getting a refund, a week later I received an email stating that my membership was to be cancelled in two months, and I was to be charged a $10.00 cancellation fee. Two months! I could not believe it. I continued to reach out and demand my money back, but the gym never picked up the phone and over Email explained to me my contract stated I must give 2 months notice before cancellation. While I hypothetically did give that notice (by saying at the beginning of the membership I only wanted it for two months), I ended up being charged for 4 months of a gym membership that I did not use.

While the gym had a history of being scummy (and recently filed for bankruptcy), my negligence was the reason I lost money. When signing up for the membership, I should have read the contract in depth and made sure the gym had on file that I only wanted the membership for two months. Furthermore, I also should have told my bank to block payments to the gym, but I did not know that was a possibility at the time. 

**Here are my tips to preventing money loss from negligence**

1. READ CONTRACTS: While I do not expect you to read every fine detail, find the part of each contract that explains how much money you owe and when. I also recommend you double check how the cancellation policy works.
2. Use credit, not debit: With a debit card, money is automatically withdrawn from your account. Once money is removed, it is gone. However, with a credit card, you are not charged until you pay off your card. This makes it much easier to refute any unwanted charge. 
3. Prepay your subscriptions: For subscriptions you know you want to keep, prepay them annually rather than monthly. Not only will you receive an added discount for committing to an annual subscription, but it will prevent you from receiving hidden recurring charges. If the service does not offer prepay, go through a third party platform (like [Ubund]( who will offer you an added discount if you prepay your subscription through them.
4. Check your bank account often: This seems obvious, but it is important to check your bank account regularly to catch hidden recurring charges before they add up. For example, for years I did not realize my Xbox 360 membership was recurring and it cost me hundreds of dollars. To prevent this error, set a recurring reminder in your phone to check your bank account.

1,j6akin,"The average American household spends over $2,000 per year on wasted food.","Did you know?

Americans waste some 40% of all edible food, according to the National Resources Defense Council. Tossing food before its time is **literally throwing money into the garbage**. *The average American household spends over $2,000 per year on wasted food.*

There seems to be confusion around dates on packages in the states. According to the [USDA &amp; FDA](, **the date printed on food labels is NOT an ""expiration"" date**.

This leads to a tremendous amount of unnecessary food waste because consumers think it's a magic date that makes their food go bad so they throw perfectly good food—out, unopened, only to be trapped in plastic in a landfill. While food companies and Big Ag profit off of this misconception.

What the dates mean:

* **Use By** The last date recommended for the use of the product while at peak quality. It is not a safety date except for when used on infant formula as we mentioned above.
* **Sell by** Tell the store how long to display the product for sale for inventory management. It is also not a safety date.
* **Best By** Indicates when a product will be of best flavor or quality. It is not a purchase or safety date. This is typically reserved for jarred or canned food.
* **The only food required by US federal law to have an ""expiration date"" is ""Baby formula"".** It has a [federally regulated expiration date]( and must be consumed within a given time period
* **Are Dates for Food Safety or Food Quality?** Manufacturers provide dating to help consumers and retailers decide when food is of best quality. Except for infant formula, **dates are not an indicator of the product’s safety and are not required by Federal law.**—[United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service](

Food waste is something everyone can do their part to prevent. Collectively it can make great change in multiple ways.

**Food waste is not just about wasting food.** It's about wasting resources that went in to making that food: all the land, time, effort, labor, inputs like water, fertilizer, harvesting, processing, packaging, fuel, shipping/transportation, storage, grocery shelf time, money. *All for 1/3 of all those things to go into a landfill? How long does it take to grow a tree that bears fruit?*

&gt;Most Date Labels Are Not Based on Exact Science  
[](

One in seven households [with children]( in America are food-insecure, and do not know where their next meal is going to come from, as are over 41 million people in America.

&gt;Americans Waste $240 Billion in Food Each Year  
[](

Why? Many people mistakenly believe that they should adhere closely to printed dates on food packaging. Americans dump *33 million tons of food into landfills each year. A typical family in the U.S. throws out 14% to 25% ( sometimes 50%) of the food they buy.*

If we take time to [educate ourselves]( about these dates we can save money, time, feed more people, and keep our landfills free of food. At the very least, we need to be composting. Food ""waste"" is a *nutrient resource*. Think of how nature works without humans on the planet. Plant and animal matter are not wasted in natural systems.

Anything that came from nature needs to go back to the soil. One teaspoon of healthy soil contains *more microbes than there are people on the planet*.

Those microbes are like trillions of microbes in our gut that enable our bodies to function properly. Both the microbes in our body and in our soil need a diversity of nutrients from different foods so they are enabled to choose what they need to do their jobs and thrive. Plants would be healthier, our air would be cleaner, we'd have less drought and get more [carbon in the soil]( The benefits of reducing food waste and using it as a resource are immeasurable.

&gt;Healthy Soil Microbes, Healthy People - The Atlantic  
There can be 10,000 to 50,000 species in less than a teaspoon of soil. In that same teaspoon of soil, there are more microbes than there are people on the earth. In a handful of healthy soil, there is more biodiversity in just the bacterial community than you will find in all the animals of the Amazon basin.

Most people don't know that grocery stores and restaurants are protected from lawsuits if they donate food to food pantries and organizations that fight hunger

&gt;The Good Samaritan Act was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, yet [it’s still a common misconception](;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11m32s) among the public and those in the food industry that a company can be liable if a recipient of donated food becomes sick after receiving the product.

1,j5ywh8,Making Saving a Lifestyle,"Saving is not a one day ordeal. Just because you ordered the grande Pumpkin Spice Latte from Starbucks rather than the Venti, does not mean you now have the freedom to buy a $500 pair of Yeezys. In fact, not even does buying the grande all year instead of the venti give you the financial freedom to buy those Yeezys. The key to financial freedom and to be able to purchase the luxuries you truly want is to make saving a *lifestyle.*

What is making saving a lifestyle? The key is to consistently save over time AND across purchasing sectors. Do not just buy the grande all year, but also buy the generic over-the-counter drug, premake your meals, prepay your subscriptions, and invest in a water purifier instead of single use water bottles. By saving consistently over time and across all areas of life (rather than using one instance of saving to incentivize unnecessary spending elsewhere) you will be able to make saving a lifestyle and ultimately have the cash to make that purchase you never thought was possible. 

So where can you begin saving consistently? Here are a few saving habits I have inherited that I believe you can too.

1. **Buy the generic brand at the pharmacy**: Almost every name brand over-the-counter drug has an identical generic brand which your pharmacy sells. The generic brand typically costs 25-80% less and is the EXACT same thing. Consumers only buy the name brand (ex. Advil, Tylenol) because they do not know about the generic equivalent. So stop buying Advil and Tylenol, start buying CVS Ibuprofen or Rite Aid acetaminophen, and start seeing more money in your bank account.
2. **Use Pharmacy prescription saving websites**: To continue the pharmacy trend, pharmacies often overprice their prescriptions on purpose due the inelasticity of drug demand. However, most pharmacies have deals with third party companies who are allowed to offer an added discount to prescription users to drive demand. Examples of these companies include [Singlecare]( and [GoodRX]( While these discounts apply mostly to people with no or very limited health insurance, I recommend checking them out.
3. **Prepay your subscriptions:** Whenever you subscribe to any service (Netflix, Playstation Plus, SkillShare etc.) be sure to check if they have an annual payment option. There are huge benefits to companies if you commit to their service for a year, and they will often provide a significant discount. If a subscription service does not have an annual option, check if they are on [Ubund]( Through Ubund, you can receive a 30%+ discount on your subscriptions if you commit to them for 1 or 2 years. Furthermore, by referring your friends to prepay through Ubund, you can receive an additional 5% discount.
4. **Get a coffee subscription**: Rather than spend $5.00/day for Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts, Panera offers unlimited coffee daily for $8.00/month. Do the math: if you spend $5.00 on coffee at Starbucks or Dunkin everyday, you spend $1825/year on coffee. If you spend $8.00 a month through subscription coffee: you pay $96/year on coffee. If you drink a daily cup of jo and have a Panera near you, this is an extremely easy way to save $1729.

What are other ways you guys save on a daily basis?

1,j5zvoi,Use Automation and Gamification,"When we first went into quarantine I was freaked out and didn't have any emergency fund saved up. Since I was stuck at home and not spending my usual $10.00 a day (on morning and afternoon coffee)  I think an Instagram ad got me motivated to direct that into automatic deposits into Stash (an investment app) and savings.

I felt silly investing with such small amounts of money, but it has slowly started to add up and I now have 3 months' rent saved without having to think about it.  I did a test on pulling money out of Stash and it only took a few days.  I can't believe I used to just let the money sit in PayPal for months collecting 0 interest or let my money sit in my chase savings which only has a 0.01 percent interest rate.

For me Auto deposits are the way to go, if I don't see money in my account I am not going to spend it.

If you are still pretty low on savings, I HIGHLY recommend Tmobile Money, they have a 4% interest on accounts under $3,000.00, and 1% if you have more than that. I switched my bill pay for my phone to the TMobile account and it kind of offsets my phone bill that way.

I am also really enjoying Yotta, I do an auto $25.00 deposit, and I get a little lottery ticket for every $25.00. I think it is the same odds as Powerball, but unlike the real lottery where you are almost guaranteed to waste $2.00 you are guaranteed to save at least $25.00. Its a really great gimmick to get you to save. It is supposed to be around 2% interest with the average prize winnings.

1,j3y8yc,Simple Tricks to Start Saving Money,"**How to save money during the pandemic-driven recession**

If you are like me, you are not completely isolated from the pandemic-driven recession. There is nothing wrong with that simple fact, and it is likely not your fault. Tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs due to COVID. While some measures have been taken to insulate Americans from the effects of the pandemic, many are still financially vulnerable. 

What can we do? We can sit around and complain, or we can be proactive and take measures to help our wallets and our quality of life. I can’t speak for you, but I have elected to take proactive measures. There are several ways that I have been making a real difference and helping my financial goals during these trying times. In this article, we will explore some simple things that you can do to help out your wallet. 

Some should consider part-time work. Regardless of what your profession is, a part-time job is a great way to receive a bit of supplemental income, while you continue your job search. Personally, I have had success driving for Uber Eats. It is easy to sign up, you can make your own schedule, and it is a reliable source of income. Do any readers have other ideas for part time jobs? I would love to hear. 

Another great way to help your financial situation is to cut costs. Obviously cutting costs is a broad instruction. One easy activity that I recommend is to make a list of all the extraneous things in your life. This will be different for every person. For example, say that you are going through a tough spot due to the pandemic, maybe you were laid off or had your hours reduced. Despite your new reality, you still find yourself going to Starbucks every morning, buying fancy shampoo, paying for a gym membership that you rarely use, etc. After taking time and listing these things out, it will help you realize that you may need to change your behavior to adjust to your new, hopefully temporary, reality. 

Think you could use some assistance cutting costs? Don’t fret, there are resources for you. Ubund is a great place to start. It has helped my save hundreds by reducing what I pay for subscriptions. All I had to do was sign up. If you, like many of us, pay monthly subscriptions for tech, media, healthcare, or education, Ubund can help you save substantial money. Ubund leverages its community to negotiate on your behalf, while also implementing a pre-payment strategy that results in money back in the pocket of members.

1,j3yu1s,Applications of the Time Value of Money,"Would you rather have five dollars today or five dollars and fifty cents in a year from now? I would wager that most said that they would prefer five dollars today. Whether or not you are conscious of it, you probably understand the time value of money. For various reasons, money is more valuable in the present than it is in the future. There are all sorts of equations and thought processes that seek to explain the phenomenon; however, it is quite simple in my mind. The logic is based off what you can do with the money in the meantime. 

As we all know, money can be used for many things. It can be saved, spent, invested, etc. All of these activities provide benefit to the transactor. Traditionally, the time value of money is founded on the benefit of saving that money and earning a compounded interest rate. Here is the fancy equation that I was referencing previously:

**FV = PV x \[ 1 + (i / n) \] (n x t)**

Where future value equals present value, times one plus the interest rate earned, divided by the number of compounding periods per year (this can vary), to the power of number of compounding periods per year, times number of years. 

The key takeaway from the equation is simply that there is value in having money now versus having money in the future, as there is a small amount of money that can be made in the meantime. Moreover, the amount of value is fluid and undetermined. If your money is simply held in a savings account, you will typically earn a little bit less than 1% per year. Though this does not seem like much, it is not moot. Time value of money becomes even more realized if you are being more aggressive with your money. Say that you are invested in a mutual fund that seeks to earn a conservative 7% per year. In this case, your money becomes even more valuable in the present, as you can take more advantage of having that money now. But going back to the 1% interest in a traditional savings account, having $1,000 now would be equal to having $1,010 in a year. 

We have already examined how having the ability of saving and investing money creates value in having money sooner rather than later. Additionally, I suggest there is a third thing that gives present money value – that thing is spending. This mechanic relies more on human psychology than mathematical formulas. Having a desire for something, whether it is a house, car, pair of shoes, TV, etc., has the ability to distort logic. We have all been in a situation where we know that something will be on sale soon, or have a decreased price in one way or another in the future, however we did not have the ability to delay our urge, and ended up buying this thing immediately, ultimately costing us money. This is certainly human; however, it does demonstrate how having the ability to buy something now also serves to give present dollars added value over future dollars. 

Time value of money is an accepted fact and can be leveraged. Ubund, the blossoming fintech platform, leverages companies’ acceptance of time value of money. Ubund does this by offering to pre-pay subscriptions to companies in exchange for the total sum being marginally lowered. This is a win-win and is a large part of how Ubund adds value to the personal finance industry. Companies win by capitalizing on time value of money – they are receiving their subscription revenue sooner, thus they can invest it in other parts of their business. Ubund wins on behalf of its users by lowering the absolute sum of money that consumers have to pay. It is a truly symbiotic relationship that Ubund is seeking to create.

1,j3ytjk,A Discussion on Bargaining Power,"Bargaining power is a fundamental piece of society. The term “bargaining power” is essentially alluding to the idea that the more people who support a common thing, the more power that thing has. In history, we have seen that ‘thing’ take on many shapes, such as a group, a cause, a revolution, etc. In this article we will explore the successes of bargaining power and how it is being utilized today.

I would argue that labor unions may be the purest form of bargaining power. Labor unions have been existent in America for hundreds of years. Many would attribute some of the rise in wages and better working conditions to the success of labor unions. Even though they are a point of political polarization for various reasons that we will not explore, it is a fact that the goal of labor unions is to advocate for their members. 

Let’s now focus on how labor unions achieve their goals. Say for example a factory has 10,000 workers and only 50 of their workers were part of the labor union trying to press the company to offer higher wages. Do you think that the labor union would achieve their goals? No, the company would simply fire the 50 troublemakers, replace them, and it would be as if nothing ever happened. However, say that 5,000 of the workers were part of the union and were threatening to strike if the company did not comply to the demands. In this situation, it would be far harder for the company to ignore or subdue the cause, because firing half of their labor force might make more inconvenience and hardship than meeting the demands of the union. 

This phenomenon is called collective bargaining. The more people who join a cause, the more likely the goals are to be achieved. We see things like this in everyday life. Some companies are even using this principal to aid their business model. In general, the more users that a company can attract to their platform, the more power that platform has. However, some thought-leading companies are even employing collective bargaining strategies in their business model. Let’s take a look at one. 

Ubund is a blossoming fintech company that employs collective bargaining as one of its core pillars.  Ubund’s goal is to offer financial solutions to customers via negotiating and pre-paying subscriptions to companies that use a subscription-based payment model. Subscription-based companies are most common in media, streaming, and SaaS (software as a service) companies. Essentially, the more users that Ubund represents, the more bargaining power that they have over the company. Just like we previously examined with labor unions, a company (in Ubund’s case it would be a company that collects subscription payments from consumers) would be far more likely to consider Ubund’s position if they represent a significant portion of the company’s users. The key difference is that Ubund is not making demands, like in the labor union examples, rather Ubund suggests a mutually beneficial solution – the consumers save money, while the company secures recurring revenue from its users. 

Bargaining power is a key principle in our society. It has been around for hundreds of years and has proven its influence time and time again. Ubund is a great example of how companies are leveraging bargaining power and using it to serve our community.

1,j3mriu,An Easy Way to Save Monthly,"I recently wrote a post about this but wanted to post it here too. Have you ever wondered why utility companies want you to make your payments automatically? They tell you it’s for your convenience. It’s actually for theirs! Automatic payments ensures that they will get paid. For people who struggle saving money, I tell them to use this same methodology.
Much like utility companies want you to set up automatic monthly payments to them, you should set one up for yourself. Figure out how much money you want to save each month, and set a recurring transfer from your checking to your savings. By making this automatic you take out the psychological warfare of actually transferring money versus spending it. I’ve been using this method for years and it really helped me get started.

That’s the gist of it, but if you’re interested in reading the entire post which has a few tips on setting the accounts up the link is here: ",6,162,easy way monthly,recently wrote post wanted post ever wondered utility company want make payment automatically tell convenience actually automatic payment ensures get paid people struggle money tell use methodology much like utility company want set automatic monthly payment set one figure much money want month set recurring transfer checking making automatic take psychological warfare actually transferring money versus spending using method year really helped get started gist interested reading entire post tip setting account link

1,j25vt3,"Spending on What you Want, and Saving Where you Can","If you are anything like me (or the average human), looking at your bank account is a roller

coaster of emotion. Usually, no matter how frugal I think I am, I am usually disappointed with the

amount of money in my account.

How can I prevent this disappointment from happening? Well, if I knew the answer to financial

freedom, I would be probably presenting this via Ted Talk, rather than by blog. However, I do

believe by budgeting in advance and actively questioning your buying decisions, taking that

weekly peek at your bank account may not be as dreadful as usual.

The key to smart budgeting is to first calculate how much of your monthly salary (post tax) is

going to necessities. No, that $500 Channel mini purse is not a necessity. Necessities include

rent, utilities, gas, insurance, food for three balanced meals a day, etc..

Once you remove my taxes and necessities from my salary, we are left with our disposable

income. Before you take “disposable” too literally, there is one more thing you should consider

before you start spending, investing. Unless you are satisfied with 1-2% interest in your savings

account (you shouldn’t be), it is imperative to take a percent of each paycheck and invest it into

the market, a retirement fund (unless you want to work forever), or an illiquid asset. Once you

remove a fixed portion for savings, now you have your true disposable income.

Before spending this remaining sum of money like a 10 year old at an arcade, I like to determine

what luxuries I am okay with spending more money on. For me, this luxury is going out to eat. I

love food, and I do not mind spending money on it as it concurrently reduces the costs of my

necessities (one less meal I need to calculate into my three balanced meals). Whatever it may

be: ice cream or Chanel purses, being cognizant of what you are willing to spend money on will

prevent you from spending on other luxuries that you will later regret.

While knowing when to spend is important for managing your disposable income, so is saving

whenever you can. Whether it is a service which automatically applies discounts to your online

purchases, or a [website]( which provides additional discounts to your subscriptions for paying

upfront, any opportunity to save will accumulate and ultimately increase your disposable

income. So take a few minutes to plan out how much you can spend and where, follow in the

footsteps of your mom and save those lengthy CVS coupons, and next time you check out your

bank account, I think you will be satisfied.",10,415,spending want,anything like average human looking bank account roller coaster emotion usually matter frugal think usually disappointed amount money account prevent disappointment happening well knew answer financial freedom would probably presenting via ted talk rather blog however believe budgeting advance actively questioning buying decision taking weekly peek bank account may dreadful usual key smart budgeting first calculate much monthly salary post tax going necessity channel mini purse necessity necessity include rent utility gas insurance food three balanced meal day etc remove tax necessity salary left disposable income take disposable literally one thing consider start spending unless satisfied interest account imperative take percent paycheck market retirement fund unless want work forever illiquid asset remove fixed portion true disposable income spending remaining sum money like year old arcade like determine luxury okay spending money luxury going eat love food mind spending money concurrently reduces cost necessity one le meal need calculate three balanced meal whatever may ice cream chanel purse cognizant willing spend money prevent spending luxury later regret knowing spend important managing disposable income whenever whether service automatically applies discount online purchase website provides additional discount subscription paying upfront opportunity accumulate ultimately increase disposable income take minute plan much spend follow footstep mom lengthy cv coupon next time check bank account think satisfied

1,itv6yt,My roommates influence has taken a toll on my savings.,"Hello! First time posting on this subreddit. I'm hoping to get some advice on this situation as it has been bothering me for quite some time since I would like to start saving and not have to live paycheck-to-paycheck. Roast me if you need to prove a point. 

I am in my third year of college and have always worked part-time in order to provide for myself. Some semesters even 2 jobs while doing full time work. During the peak of the pandemic, I was able to save up quite a lot of money in order to hold me over for rent and basic necessities for the following months in case I wasn't able to find work. Yet, my roommate has always influenced me to bleed money out of my ass even with work.  

Most of the time it isn't intentional though! I genuinely think that spending something that like coffee or outside food like every other week is OK. But with my roommate, they order out every other 3 DAYS and we typically order in a group so one person has to pay and the rest pay back. Guess what? I am ALWAYS the person to pay the whole order. I am fine with it on the occasional but orders are usually $30 to $80 (3 people). My other roommate pays me back immediately but it will take a month or so for this one to get back to me which is not good and very annoying as I have to constantly remind them. Coffee and little things are also a factor. 

I need to save because I will be graduating soon and start to pay off my student loans. What are some suggestions or budgeting advice? I'm not sure if I should get a credit card for emergencies but I also want to minimize my debt so my plan was to not get one until more than half of my student debt is paid. :P",10,328,roommate influence taken toll,hello first time posting subreddit hoping get advice situation bothering quite time since would like start live paycheck paycheck roast need prove point third year college always worked part time order provide semester even job full time work peak pandemic able quite lot money order hold rent basic necessity following month case able find work yet roommate always influenced bleed money as even work time intentional though genuinely think spending something like coffee outside food like every week ok roommate order every day typically order group one person pay rest pay back guess always person pay whole order fine occasional order usually people roommate pay back immediately take month one get back good annoying constantly remind coffee little thing also factor need graduating soon start pay student loan suggestion budgeting advice sure get credit card emergency also want minimize debt plan get one half student debt paid p

1,ipn2o1,2 Easy Ways to Properly Save during COVID without Changing your Lifestyle,"Whether it is the loss of a loved one, the loss of your job, or a missed opportunity, COVID-19 has affected everyone in some way. While the worst of the Coronavirus seems to be over, we are left with an extremely uncertain future. Will I be able to keep my job? Will I be able to find a job? Will I be able to complete my degree? Whether it is to pay for expenses right now, or to save for uncertainty in the future, almost everyone has a need to save money right now. 

Most blogs on how to save will give you a solution which is either a redistribution of your current wealth, a lifestyle change, or a combination of both. For example, common solutions to increase savings include cancelling your subscriptions, ordering take-out less, and creating an emergency savings fund. COVID-19 has taken away enough from us, and we deserve to be able to maintain the subscriptions and lifestyle we desire; and while it is important to have a savings and budgeting plan, it is not a concrete solution to saving or gaining money right now.

How can I have more money in my pocket now?

1. Pay less for the same subscriptions

An easy way to maintain your lifestyle and subscriptions while paying less is to sign up for Ubund, a financial services provider which negotiates and reduces your bills for you. For any subscription you may have (ex.

2. Strategically invest whatever you can.

Despite the steep economic impacts of COVID, the stock market continues to rise and it is a great time to be invested in the market. While money may be tight because of COVID, a great way to accumulate a substantial portfolio without making a large upfront investment is through micro-investing apps such as [Acorns]( Whether it is your Starbucks coffee or filling up your gas tank, Acorns will round up whatever you spend on your credit card to the nearest dollar and will invest the difference in the market for you. Acorns is a great way to use the stock market to your advantage without taking a significant upfront investment of cash. However, if possible, I also recommend directly investing a portion of your savings into the market yourself. While the uncertainty of COVID makes investing in high growth stocks risky, safely investing in the market is easy and will provide consistent returns. If you have no experience investing, I wrote an article explaining how you can easily go from no investing experience to becoming an informed and risk-averse investor.

1,ipbol0,Quick tips for anyone who is the victim of a crime without income for the foreseeable future,"On April 1st 2019 I survived an attempted murder. Believe it or not, after almost two years, the men (millionaires) have pled down to misdemeanors after extending the criminal trial for over a year and a half thanks to the most expensive defense attorneys that the state of Ohio can offer. 2 facial reconstructions and a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia later, I am still here. Aside from all of that f*ckery, here are some tips to help you survive.

1. Look into VOC (victims of crime compensation). After making 50k the tax season before the crime happened, I just last week received my approval letter for a 4K slap in the face that should arrive in 2-3 weeks. It’s something. Although it won’t get my car out of impound or even clear up my bank account, or even put a dent in my overdue utilities, I have heard that they do better for some people. 
You will have to have done your taxes to prove your income at the time of the crime.

2. Apply for food assistance and never eat out again. Never buy precooked frozen stuff. Cook at home from scratch if you can. After my life came to a complete halt, cooking is one of the few things I enjoy now. 

3. If someone starts you a crowdfund. Make sure they’re someone you absolutely trust. The woman who made mine turned out to be downright evil. Also, people may come out of the woodwork and start a conversation by saying “so, I saw you had a gofundme, any chance you could spot me for...” tell them to fuck off. I was somehow able to make 9k from a crowdfund last nearly an entire year. (Just paying rent and utilities) you may have to let the rest go as I had to. 

4. Try your ass off to get a case manager through a non profit for people who are victims of crimes, most of them are underpaid and drop the ball. You have to pursue them unfortunately. 

5. Most of the people you used to call your friends and loved ones may abandon you as you will become a burden to them. Let life trim the fat. At times it has only been myself and whatever God I picked that day. (Tried damn near all of them). Do not expect people to pull through for you. If someone is there for you, you hit the lottery.  My family stole my restitution checks and told me they never came. Other than that you are mostly on your own. (This has little to do with finances unless you’re spending your own money to see people who don’t care about you after all) 

6. Cancel anything that’s autopay. Just do it. You can always resubscribe when you’re out of the woods. 

7. Change your type of banking account to one that is either prepaid or one that won’t allow you to drop into negatives. Usually this takes away some privileges that other checking accounts can have. Suck it up lol. 

8. Don’t you dare use any crowdfunded money or even your own to party or buy any sort of recreational drug. You will be shooting yourself in the foot and throwing gasoline on the fire.

9. If you have suicidal ideations during this, please reach out to a professional for help. Suicide hotline is 800-273-8255. I have been there time and time again through these last two years. (Felt this was absolutely necessary to add) 

10. Work if you absolutely can, when you can. I could not and still can’t, but have faired well with the bartering system somehow. Worth a try. 

11. Do not let people take advantage of you, you’d be surprised and appalled. People that seemed normal tried to buy me. And by that I mean offer to pay my bills in exchange for an unspoken agreement they made with me where I was to fall in love with them or let them have sex with me. THIS IS A THING. BE VERY CAREFUL. 

12. The criminal court process is slow. Very very slow. People seem to think they know all about the judicial system, I assure you they don’t. Talk to the prosecutor you’re involved with for updates on your case. It will not go as fast or at all the way that people say it will. You need to ask people with a law degree for advice if need be. Also, don’t hold out for any sort of restitution unless you file civilly, which can also take years. 

13. Apply for Ssdi if the situation calls for it. You will absolutely get denied twice and have to hire an attorney (they will take a percentage of your ssdi back pay) but they are necessary for you to get approved for something like that these days.

1,ii4oiz,Swissborg community app - giving free coins for future investment,"Hey all,

Not sure if this is of interest to anyone but I joined up this app where if you complete the tasks they give you free crypto coins for gaining the badges.

Once you download the app all you need to do is guess whether the bit coin price will have risen or dropped after 24 hours and stake the points as a gamble... it takes up about 2 minutes of your day and you get given 200 points a day to use for the guess. They have a competition going that the more points you have, the more of the bitcoin prize pool you win.

You can earn a max of 1750 of the CHSB coins if you get all the badges. These coins are worth about 8-9p at the moment but maybe the future they may go up... might just be worth trying to a get some and a few years down the line having a nice surprise pot to sell?

They don't ask for any bank or credit card details to use the app and it can be downloaded on IOD or android. As I say if this post manages to help anyone in the future then its been worth posting.

If you sign up using [swissborg community app](
And my reference code CTC66BI you'll get 3000 points to start you off Instead of just 200, you'll be helping me too of course.

1,idnl6g,Save money in your prime saving years. It's possible to save a ton of money when your young.,"I feel it's imperative to write this.  Not for someone my age, but for the younger generation.  Looking back, I feel like the stance I took on my finances helped me get into a place where I can retire early.

And the thing is, saving money and acquiring wealth sounds hard.  But if your born into a thriving economy, then you have a real opportunity to save.

And that's with little to no knowledge of money.  No need to understand stocks.  REIT's.  Or even get-rich-quick schemes.  I know I never did.  Now later, this is all stuff you should learn.  Minus the get-rich-quick stuff, because most riches come through pure hard work and traditional investments.

&amp;#x200B;

I see so many people living beyond their means.  Especially the young generation.  You know, from 22-28, you want to be a baller.  Out there spending like your a rock star.

It's unfortunate.  And it's not entirely their fault.  After all, I was never target marketed by huge corporations to use a credit card or buy lavish goods at a young age.  At least I don't think I was.

&amp;#x200B;

Now more than ever before, I'm seeing younger generations spend every penny they make.  The signs are everywhere.  I drove by an small house in Burbank California last week with a Rolls Royce parked on the street.  And I know the owner is a resident in the house, because I've seen this car there for months.  And he's only about 25 and the home he lives in is his parents.

Now who knows the story, although I suspect it's similar to so many I see.  Young people leasing costly items, like luxury cars, in an attempt to show status.  It's really the wrong path.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's possible to save lots of money without having knowledge of anything about finance, because I've done it.  When I got out of college, I was a numskull.  I was about as far from a business minded individual as one could get.

&amp;#x200B;

But I knew one thing, how to not live beyond my means.  To not get trapped into purchasing luxury items.  I knew that, as a young bachelor, I needed next to nothing to be happy and survive.  It was the prime time of my life to save.

I managed to save 100k after college after starting my first job with just 25k in income.  4 years later, my salary was tripled, and I had 100k packed away and was well on my way to early retirement.  In my opinion, the early years of your life are the optimal time to save money.

&amp;#x200B;

It will not only set a tone for your life, as a saver, but it will also provide you with an emergency fund and investment options.

If your a new graduate, or even trying to save money as a young person, I'd suggest you take a minute to think about how you can save money quickly during your prime saving years.  I made a more extensive post, and your welcome to read more if your interested: [How I saved 100k on a 75k income in 4 years](",18,539,money prime year possible ton money young,feel imperative write someone age younger generation looking back feel like stance took finance helped get place retire early thing money acquiring wealth sound hard born thriving economy real opportunity little knowledge money need understand stock reit even get rich quick scheme know never later stuff learn minus get rich quick stuff rich come pure hard work traditional investment amp x b see many people living beyond mean especially young generation know want baller spending like rock star unfortunate entirely fault never target marketed huge corporation use credit card buy lavish good young age least think amp x b ever seeing younger generation spend every penny make sign everywhere drove small house burbank california last week roll royce parked street know owner resident house seen car month home life parent know story although suspect similar many see young people leasing costly item like luxury car attempt show status really wrong path amp x b know possible lot money without knowledge anything finance done got college numskull far business minded individual one could get amp x b knew one thing live beyond mean get trapped purchasing luxury item knew young bachelor needed next nothing happy survive prime time life managed k college starting first job k income year later salary tripled k packed away well way early retirement opinion early year life optimal time money amp x b set tone life saver also provide emergency fund option new graduate even trying money young person suggest take minute think money quickly prime year made extensive post welcome read interested k k income year

1,i951mx,A short term goal.. Reasonable?,"Friendly hello from canada here. 
So I have a short term goal for the next 6 months to save 50k
I dont know if I need a better budget or if I need a better mindset for the goal I want to achieve or what. I like to spend my money. I like to go for random trips or day trips. 
And in all honesty I am not entirely sure on what I want from this post. But maybe just a push in the right direction..

A little about this. I am a heavy equipment operator and I make 36/h with $140 non taxed allowance per day.  That will be around $3528 before taxes per week of 12 hour days. Plus 980 un taxed per week. I have taken in to factor of a 30% tax deduction so I am looking at approx $2469.6 after tax take home with the allowance $3450....
 so in the 6 months of planned work I have run a few numbers on the shift I will be working and it will be around $86,000. 
 Obviously I need to make a budget and see to what my expenses are over my savings. 

What I have already been doing is just spending whatever I want through out a week and whatever is left on payday from the week prior I put it all into my savings. It could be 50$or it could be 1500$ depending on what bill or expense I dealt with that week.

1,i0zfjz,5 Accounts - My Savings Strategy,"Just wanted to share a tip of mine I have been using to save money for a few years now. Maybe it sounds crazy but I have 5 separate accounts my direct deposit goes into lol

1. Chase Checking Account - this is my primary account that I use for everyday expenses. This is my “leftover” amount as these other accounts always have the same amount go in them. 

2. Chase Savings Account - this is where I dump as much money as possible and also pay my student loans out of. I put in more than my loans so I use it for occasional expenses too if I need to use it for a copay or something along those lines.

3. Joint Checking with my girlfriend - we live together so this amount is rent along with $35 as a random savings amount every check.

3. Capital One Checking - this one is really what helped manage my expenses and save. What I deposit  in this account covers exactly my solo monthly bills: phone, cable, streaming, dollar shave club,electric. 

5. Capital One Savings - I only throw $25 in here every check, but I never ever touch it! I actually have had this one longer than the capital one checking. I started this years ago as a means to save up for a new car, and that is the only time I have ever used it when my car got totaled a few years back. I kept it going and have not taken out since. 

Obviously this would work different depending on pay and frequency I suppose. I get paid weekly which makes the math easier, at least it seems that way. I know some companies limit the amount of accounts on direct deposits as well which can make this difficult.

1,hsmq8t,"HIGH INTEREST Savings Account, compounded daily","[click here!!](

I just wanted to share:
I had a savings account at HSBC and it started out with 2.2%APY payed out to me monthly. Because of covid and stuff (I assumed) that APY is currently at 0.7% and the highest savings account now is citibank with 1.4%APY. I wanted to switch to them but I decided not to, because I think that the interest will go down again. So I decided to give beam a try because I did not want to wait 1x a month to receive 0.7% interest. Its way too low 🙄🙄🙄

So I now use Beam as my main and only savings account. (I closed HSBC because the rate inflates all the time) My interest rate with beam is currently at 3.71% and they pay this interest to me daily. So I currently have $1,500 in it, and i will receive $0.15 daily basically. And everyday you will receive your interest payout with the current balance, so in my case I will receive 3.71% of $1,500.15 and so on.

It really does seem too good to be true, but i’ve used it for a while and it really is a great way to generate passive income from opening up a high-yield savings account so I thought I’d share it to you all. And in case you are interested you can use my link to get $10,000 credit. So if your interest is at 2%, you will get 2% of that $10,000 which pretty much makes the interest payout much higher because you have a higher base balance. 

I was really skeptical at first when I read some bad reviews, but I can confidently say that I have had no problems in transferring money in and out, although it takes a day or two extra to pull money in and out from the account. This savings account is like any other big name brands like Chase, Bofa, HSBC, Citibank, etc which are all FDIC insured so your money is safe. 

If you have any questions you can ask me, I’d be able to answer some general ones based on experience and you can use my link so that you get the extra bonus and $10k credit to temporarily increase your base balance for 30days!

1,hipkj8,Chrome Extension that shows you other store websites that are selling the same product at cheaper prices while you are shopping online,"TLDR - [www.octoshop.org](

A couple friends and I built a chrome extension called OctoShop (www.octoshop.org) to show you other retailers that have the product you are looking for when you are browsing online. When you go to Amazon, for example, OctoShop will show what Walmart, Target, etc are selling the same product for so you can always get the best price without manually checking 20 different stores.

I’ll give a disclaimer at the beginning of this post that I understand this is dependant on a lot of factors, so I’m happy with an estimate and expect no concrete figures. 

In short, I consider myself frugal and good at saving money, however, I’m curious to know what people would say is a good amount to have saved up at 25 (ideally, UK specific, though anywhere is useful to know). Essentially, I want a benchmark so I can see how well or badly I’m doing.

Presumably he could set his thermostat 20 degrees higher, and sleep in his basement at the same 70 degrees he's used to upstairs. How much money could you save in power by doing this?

1,hf0nqd,The Frugal Wife's tips for How To Live Below Your Means And Save Money || 7 Ways To Save Money,"Do you know the key to saving money consistently? It's living below your means. All too often, our lifestyle tends to expand whenever we get a salary increase. If we're not careful, it expands beyond our means as we treat ourselves to fancy clothes, jewels, new cars, and vacations in sunny destinations. Often we feel obliged to put on a display of false prosperity to gratify our ego or to earn esteem in the eyes of others. But this primrose path leads to overdue credit card statements, missed payments, wrecked credit scores, sleepless nights, and eventually bankruptcy.

But if you put yourself in the right mindset, you can avoid this trap and start building your future upon a rock. 

Don't think too much about what other people are thinking or saying. Here are 7 ways to start living below your means.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Understand your means ; what is your take home pay? After taxes and other contributions?

 This is an important starting part. How much is it that you have to spend from month-to-month. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Downsize your home if possible.

Ask yourself:

Are you using all the space in your house? Do you have a guest room that no one uses? or only rarely? If so, consider moving into a smaller residence. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Save from the start (Pay yourself first)

Put money aside for savings first. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Reduce your non-essentials.

Do you need to buy coffee at the cafe?

Do you need to buy clothes every month? Does that really need to be part of your budget?

&amp;#x200B;

5. Keep track of your spending 

Put all your receipts in an envelope. Put everything in a spreadsheet. Keep track of services you've cancelled to make sure they aren't charging you. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. Create a budget (Do you have a budget?) 

Your money needs a map. Create zero based budget. i.e., Nothing should be left over after expenses and savings. 

&amp;#x200B;

7. Use credit card wisely.

Make sure you pay off balance regularly. Don't pay interest. Build credit rating. Get points and cashback.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, stop worrying about what others are saying about you and focus on building your long-term prosperity.

1,hbvs48,High Yield Interest &amp; Amazing Cashback card,"The MCO Cryptocurrency Platinum Visa Card is what I consider to be the best Cash-Back card in the world right now. Its treated like a credit card at merchants but functions more like a pre-paid debit card. Although its called a Cryptocurrency card, you actually load it with Fiat like USD. It depends on ur membership level (1-5) but here is a list of some the best perks.

- Perk 1 - Up to 5% cashback on all purchases depending on your membership level. It might not sound like much but it will add up through the years. 
You spend so much money every year but wouldn't it be nice to have a universal cashback card that works on everything and not just select items. 
I personally have the 3% cashback one and its great. 



- Perk 2 - No Monthly Fees, No Annual Fees, No Upkeep Fees, No Minimum Balance Fees, No Hidden Fees and No Fees for the Card (Metal) or the Delivery.



- Perk 3 - You get a 100% Free Rebate back on your months subscription to Spotify, Netflix and Amazon Prime depending on your membership level. 
Level 2 gets you Spotify. 
Level 3 gets you Spotify and Netflix. 
Level 4 &amp; 5 gets you Spotify, Netflix and Amazon


I currently get free Spotify and Netflix each month which would normally cost me over $300 a year. You also get the cashback bonus on those so your actually gaining money to use those services for free.


- Perk 4 - You gain free unlimited membership to Lounge Key which gives you access to over 600 Airport's VIP area where you can shower, get free food and sleep in a bed. You normally have to pay $32 dollars to enter a single time and airport food is always so overpriced. 


- Perk 5 - No Fee ATM Monthly Withdrawal Limit up to a $1000.00 &amp; up to $10000.00 for Interbank Exchange Rates Monthly Limit.


- Perk 6 - Increased APY Interest for all Cryptocurrency and Stable Coins by 2-3% up to 14% for all currency in their wallet. This is a big one for me but probably doesn't sound like much to the regular household member. I'll go into more detail for those not familiar with cryptocurrency and why I think this is important.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


A guide to high Annual Percentage Yield

A stablecoin is cryptocurrency that is backed by the government and always has a fixed value. 
For example, 1 US Dollar = 1 USDC or 1 USDT

The company has a Minimum APY of 6% and goes up to 14% for stable coins so $10,000 USDC will give you anywhere from $600 at minimum to $1400 a year in interest earned depending on how long you lock it up for from 1 month to 3 months. You dont have to lock up ur money and still get a 6% APY. Alot of traditional banks don't come anywhere near those interest rates. This is a great way to gain passive income and having over 150k could potentially let you live off the interest alone. 


- Perk 7 - I don't get access to these but level 4 and 5 cards give you additional perks like free access to private jets, access to their inside club private investing firm and a bunch of other stuff like 10% off Expedia and airbnb


- Perk 8 - This isn't actually a perk but more like feature of the company. They give you a Credit Line thats equal to half of your wallet balance. 


For a full list of Perks then you can go to the website -  


There are some requirements for those Perks so I'll use myself as an example. I have the Jade level 3 membership card and the requirement is to stake 500 MCO for 6 months. 
Each MCO is currently valued at $4.68 right now and thats a total of $2340.00 that I initially put down.
After the 6 month period is over then you can sell those 500 MCO anytime you want. This means that you could potentially both gain or lose money depending on the current value of MCO. After the 6 months are over with then you have to continue staking in order to gain access to those Perks but there isn't a lockup period anymore and you can liquidate your MCO anytime you want. 


MCO Price Analysis 

The company made a good strategic move which requires users to continue stake in order to gain access to those perks so the incentive to sell is lower than most coins which results in more people holding than selling. By the laws of supply and demand, this means that its actually more likely to increase in price. 
Its not much but I also gain the 8% APY on MCO during the 6 month mandatory staking period which comes out to around $187.00 a year. 


Risk Assessment 

- They are insured up to 360M 
- They are the first company to reach CCSS Level 3 (Crypto Currency Security Standard) 
- The company put alot of money down to get the original crypto.com domain name and went from 1 Million Users to 2 Million users in the last 6 months. I personally think they are on the verge of exploding. 


I recommend to people who just want to try it out to go for the Level 2 membership, the Red Card which has 2% cashback on all purchases, Free Monthly Spotify and ATM withdrawals. This one is relatively low risk and its perks are still pretty good. For this one, you need to stake 50 MCO for 6 months to get this card and you get 10 MCO for free just by registering anyways. Another 10 MCO if you use my referral code I think. After the initial 6 months then you can sell the 50 MCO to regain all the original money you spent anytime you want. For the record, you gain access to those perks immediately, you don't have to wait 6 months. The blue level 1 card has a 1% cashback and is free to sign up if you dont want to stake. 


Insurance 

This probably isn't needed but the safe thing to do would be to put a limit stop on the MCO after the 6 month is over and set it 10-20% below the market price in case it drops which would ensure that the loss is minimal. I anticipate that MCO will increase in price in the coming years as the company grows anyways but even if it does drops then I personally don't plan on selling because the cashback, free netflix, spotify and interest are going to save me more money in the long run.

They can check their progress against each other, with prizes for reaching certain milestones first (either a cash bonus, or a gift card etc).

1,gur8b3,A few tips that works on how to save money!,"Hi Reddit! 

For the last 3 years I have struggled to save money. I finally came up with a solution that works. 

When you have cash and you buy something, put the rest of the bills away in an envelope. You buy a soda for $1, break a $20, put $19 away. In a physical envelope, not your bank. That's very important. I will explain later why. 

If you have ones in your bag, shove em in the envelope. You found money? Put it in the envelope. Whenever you see a bill and don't need to spend it. Throw it in there.  But never EVER count what's in the envelope. 

The reason why you do this is because temptation. If you know you have money, you will want to spend it. That's why piggy banks work, you have to break them in order to get the money, therefore losing the object in the process. It's designed to hurt a little bit. 

If you have an envelope with bills stuffed in it, you don't know how much you have. 

And you can't borrow from it. It has an imaginary lock on it. You spend it and you can just throw the rest of your money away because then, what's the point? You're not saving, you're still hurting yourself.

After a while you can count it. It'll be a lot of money, since you will be throwing random bills in there. $20, $10, $5, $1. 

With this method I was able to get $300 in a few weeks saved.",10,257,tip work money,hi reddit last year struggled money finally came solution work cash buy something put rest bill away envelope buy soda break put away physical envelope bank important explain later one bag shove em envelope found money put envelope whenever see bill need spend throw never ever count envelope reason temptation know money want spend piggy bank work break order get money therefore losing object process designed hurt little bit envelope bill stuffed know much borrow imaginary lock spend throw rest money away point still hurting count lot money since throwing random bill method able get week

1,godteg,Father took my money for 8 YEARS!,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. 

As a kid I loved saving money. We never got money for doing chores. Which I understand. So I would clean neighbors yards, houses, and or groom their pets. A handful of times my dad would take the money. My neighbor gave me $50 for mowing her lawn and cleaning up her yard. I was around 12 or so. My father took the money and said we needed it for food. Once I turned 15 my dad was constantly on me for finding a job. The day of my birthday he took me to fast food restaurants and made me apply for jobs. If they didn't hire me he would yell at me and say it's my fault. After a few months I got my first job at McDonald's. This was back in 2008. I was getting $6.25. My first paycheck was around $70. I got yelled at for it not being big enough. This went on for 8 years. My dad eventually gave me $25 a week for ""food"". But I wouldn't spend it so I could save up. Because anytime I said I wanted or needed something he would say no and that I don't work hard enough. After 8years I decided to move out and keep my own paychecks. At first I didn't know how to save up. I would spend my money as soon i got it. I worked hard and bought 2 vehicles and anything I wanted it. Later on I sold both vehicles, walked to work which was only 2min away. Sold anything I did not use and lived a very cheap life style. With in 3 months I was able to save 10k. I got engaged and ended up spending all that and 10k more. I became very depressed and went back to living off paycheck to paycheck. I fell into debt and couldn't afford a decent vehicle. I landed a good paying job and saved up 7k. Paid off my debt and started from square one. I told my wife we should save up for a house and in the past 3 months we were able to save 11k. Our apartment lease isn't up until October. Hopefully by then I'll have $20k + saved up and be able to purchase my first house. I haven't spoken to my father in months because of what he did.

I’m 25, and have no savings. I have a little bit of money in an IRA from one job. I have always struggled with money, spending too much and not saving anything. I regret living this way and now I feel stressed about my future.

I am self employed, so my income is fluctuating. I make 4-5k/month before taxes. I could probably make more but I’ve just been struggling to get motivated.

I spend $1,600/mo on rent which I know is ridiculous but there is a housing crisis where I live and very few affordable options. I’m stuck in this lease til next Feb. I have plans to move in with my bf when he finishes building a new house next year. 

Other than that, I don’t really have a budget. I spend too much on groceries and online shopping. I just signed up for a savings account but I also feel like all the money I save will just end up going towards taxes. 

I don’t even know where to begin and I just feel embarrassed and worried about my financial stability",5,196,even start,hey everyone hoping advice getting started becoming fiscally responsible little bit money ira one job always struggled money spending much anything regret living way feel stressed future self employed income fluctuating make k month tax could probably make struggling get motivated spend mo rent know ridiculous housing crisis live affordable option stuck lease til next feb plan move bf finish building new house next year really budget spend much grocery online shopping signed account also feel like money end going towards tax even know begin feel embarrassed worried financial stability

For those who have saved enough money to be able to invest (LONG-TERM) in stocks, the current stock market status (Recent historic drop) represents a great opportunity and it is highly possible that the stock market low in 2020 will be the lowest we will see in our lifetimes. Most stocks currently have retreated 30% or more and even if it goes down a little further, this is a great time to dive into large cap stocks (e.g. MSFT, KO, PEP, JNJ, etc.) or stock funds (Preferred). One of my favorite funds is VTI, Vanguard's total market ETF.

1,fha5g8,"Saving Money (And Make Money) Summary and Tips (Struggles, Habit, and List of Tips)","Hi Everyone,
Support me if this helps. One of my first posts but I'll try to squeeze as much in as possible (Might be a bit jumbled) as certain points may help certain individuals. One thing that helps me with saving and being able to get into 6-digit figures is habit. Habit of saving and always looking to find ways to save. I grew up below average and thus always felt like I needed to make sure I can stop struggling (e.g.hungry, missing out on events, couldn't pay for trips when friends took them, couldn't eat better food, limited to many other things, you get the picture). All these struggles and problems forced me to make sure almost 100% as possible to never get back to this  struggling state. Now in my 30s, I can tell you that once you build a habit, it becomes easy and part of your life to save. I can extend this all day but understand that you save and then eventually learn to invest those savings into bigger and better things (Will share more in later posts). As I've been to a few other countries, I've seem people happy with a small fraction of what has become the norm (Large homes, luxurious foods, expensive clothing, new or newer cars, etc.) in American life. The most important statement I can share is ""If you want to live different and be able to save and invest more than others or the above the average, you have to live a lifestyle and make decisions that are DIFFERENT than the average person"". For example, 80% (Just estimating) of people buy new or expensive cars instead of saving $5K a year or buy $2000 worth of snowboarding equipment when it can be bought for a couple hundred dollars. Many more examples but just trying to make a point. Be different; make different decisions. I won't go deep into investing in this post. Finally, here is a list of known and experienced actions that have worked for me and many others that will free up cash (And make money) and help put you in a better position (These are actually things I do and not random tips). Also, I always try to explain or give examples and not just plain out make a statement.  All may not apply to you hut be creative. Main thing is be consistent. Everyone has a different formula but most formulas have derived from a combination of others' formulas. 
- Always think about saving a fraction of your income whether it is 10%, 20%, etc. Don't think you cannot because you don't make enough (Big mistake). You cannot tell me you always make just enough money and cannot save. Again, build a habit. 
- Don't buy new cars. Waste of high insurance, registration, and depreciation costs. I've purchased $3000 Honda Civics and the last 3 have lasted over 6 years without any problems. Just be smart and test drive the crap out of the car when buying. Spend the $100 for the diagnostic test if not comfortable. 
- If you have a house/condo/etc., rent out rooms. I've done this for the last 8 years. Imagine if just 1 room allows an extra $600/month in your pocket. 
- Use online sites for deals. Example: slickdeals.ney
- Use online coupons. They are everywhere. Just google it. 
- Cancel expensive TV services. Use streaming services. 
- Check for cheaper car and home insurance annually or every 2 years, especially if yours keeping going up. 
- Use apps for food discounts. Bad example but check McDonald's app. Always free or BOGO offers. Same with many others. 
- I can dive into this way more but save and invest in stocks. If you don't  know much, just keep investing in Vanguard funds (e.g. VTI). Don't listen to people who say stock investing is gambling. Short-term and day trading stocks are gambling, proper long-term is not. Stock funds and economy always trend up long-term and even during times they go down, your dividends would get reinvested. Again, so much more to this. 
- Once or if you have extra money down the road, buy an investment home to rent out. Good tax savings due to mortgage interest, property tax, etc. 
- Start researching credit cards that offer points and cashback. A lot more to this but possibly start researching Chase credit cards. Check ""Chase quadfecta"" in google. 
- Buy furniture on Craigslist, Nextdoor, Facebook Marketplace, etc. Items could also include lawn mowers, appliances, etc.
- Most people stockpile so much used items. Sell all your unused old items on those sites I just mentioned. You'll be surprised. 

Still enjoy life. No need to do any major cuts. Some people try to skimp on things that eventually ruins their comfort (e.g. trying to cut down on A/C). This list is not everything (So much more) but I hope it helps you generate ideas. This is more like tid bits from a lot of things we can discuss. As mentioned, be different, be consistent.

1,fa1yry,Here the plan i use that works for me,"Put $5.00 to $10.00 aside each pay


Ever spending order offline or on put $1.00 away


If the order comes to $3.30 then round it to the nearest dollar and put that away. So here it would be a 70c savings.


If there is a savings ticket on it of an amount smaller then $20.00 then put the savings amount away. Example is if the groceries ticket has a ""Total savings"" on it saying $1.60 you put that away too…


If the order is a 2 for $5.00 deal and each item has an individual price of $4.20 then put the difference away. Example 4.2 x 2 is 8.4… 8.4 -5 is 3.4

So put $ 3.40 aside as well as the $1.00 too


So a good example is this


The order was a 2 for $5.50 and individual price was $4.50. And gst was 30c.


So you would put $5.30 away.

1,cucfrh,My clever way of saving $$$,"So my fiancee and I are just terrible at saving money. I have tried setting cash aside in a separate bank account, tried putting cash in a box, tried the app Digit, tried Acorns, nothing seems to work!

We currently live in an apartment, we have some debt, I need a new car soon, we are going to buy a house in the future, we are getting married this fall, how can we do any of these without a dime in our savings? 

This is my method, and in one months time I have been able to save about $130. 

What you need
#1.) An old book you don't care about (or go to the thrift store and buy one) 
#2.) A box or container to put said book in 
#3.) A spot to put said box in that's out of sight and out of mind, that's also kind of annoying to get to (more on that in a second) 

Each week (or if I get a tip at work) I go to the bank and buy $2 bills from them. There's something about the $2 that I just can't spend them, whether it might be ""good luck"" or the rumor that they are ""rare"" I'm not sure.

Put each bill inbetween the pages of the book, put the book in the box and now here's your chance to find a creative hiding place that has a decent amount of ""opposing force"" on your mind. 

For instance, say you don't typically go in your basement, put the box down there somewhere, underneath something, in something else, behind something, etc. So when your brain says ""Let's spend money you've been saving!"" Hopefully this spot is just difficult enough where then it becomes ""Well then I need to go downstairs, all the way in the back, under ""xxx"", then I have to open the box and then flip through all the pages in the book to get some money."" And here's where the $2 bill part comes into play, a LOT of people don't want to spend them! (Where if it was just ""regular"" bills, you wouldn't care now would you?) 

Here's why I use a book vs just putting bills in a box, you don't see the amount you have. You flip to an empty page, place a bill in there, close it and you're done. (Unfortunately if I see a dollar amount in my checking account, I just assume we have money.....) 

Also, if you're not sure where to find $2 bills, just call any local bank. Luckily where my employer takes the deposit the main teller always carries them.

If you've made it all the way down here, please comment and let me know your thoughts. Maybe I'm absolutely bonkers for thinking such an idea, but at least in my case it seems to be working fairly well.",6,475,clever way,fiancee terrible money tried setting cash aside separate bank account tried putting cash box tried app digit tried acorn nothing seems work currently live apartment debt need new car soon going buy house future getting married fall without dime method one month time able need old book care go thrift store buy one box container put said book spot put said box sight mind also kind annoying get second week get tip work go bank buy bill something spend whether might good luck rumor rare sure put bill inbetween page book put book box chance find creative hiding place decent amount opposing force mind instance say typically go basement put box somewhere underneath something something else behind something etc brain say let spend money hopefully spot difficult enough becomes well need go downstairs way back xxx open box flip page book get money bill part come play lot people want spend regular bill care would use book v putting bill box see amount flip empty page place bill close done unfortunately see dollar amount checking account assume money also sure find bill call local bank luckily employer take deposit main teller always carry made way please comment let know thought maybe absolutely bonkers thinking idea least case seems working fairly well

1,bccj3d,Quick Comparison of 3 Star ACs vs 5 Star ACs: Which is more Efficient?,"Our earth is dying and our natural resources are depleting. If we continue with this rate, we will be left with no coal to power our electricity plants, no water or food to feed our children. The luxury items such as TV, refrigerator and especially ACs emit a lot of harmful pollutants that affect our environment. To deal with this global environmental problem, different organizations including the BEE came up with an idea - to categorize consumer electronics products such as the ones named above into efficient and not efficient. 

To make the categorization easier for people to understand, BEE started marking the energy efficiency of electronic items using stars; one star being the lowest energy efficient and five stars being the highest energy efficiency. 

&amp;#x200B;

[3 Star ACs vs  5 Star ACS](;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a538658844ec41573efe549d8a4652460948bd62)

&amp;#x200B;

This star marking was to give consumers an idea of which AC is best for them. For example, if someone is planning to buy an AC, they had to make sure that they choose at least a 3-star AC. Though 5-star ACs are more recommended, 3-star ACs still do a fine job. Yet, when you are to choose either one of the two ACs, you can consider the cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pricing of the product is the first thing you consider if the quality quotient is equally high with all the options available in the market. So, when you are buying an AC and you are stuck with whether you should get a 3-Star AC or a 5-Star AC; you should base your decision on pricing. Now, needless to say, a [5-star AC]( would be much more expensive compared to a 3-star AC since it is much more energy efficient. Here, you can either buy a less energy efficient product or increase your budget. You can also buy a 5-star AC on No-Cost EMI. 



No-Cost EMI plans are available with almost all Air Conditioners available online and offline in EMI stores. The process of buying ACs on No-Cost EMI is also very easy. While shopping online, you just have to add your EMI card in your preferred payment option and then pay using the card. While you are shopping for a product offline, you can let the sales representative help you with the purchase.",14,374,quick comparison star ac v star ac efficient,earth dying natural resource depleting continue rate left coal power electricity plant water food feed child luxury item tv refrigerator especially ac emit lot harmful pollutant affect environment deal global environmental problem different organization including bee came idea categorize consumer electronics product one named efficient efficient make categorization easier people understand bee started marking energy efficiency electronic item using star one star lowest energy efficient five star highest energy efficiency amp x b star ac v star ac format png amp auto webp amp ec efe bd amp x b star marking give consumer idea ac best example someone planning buy ac make sure choose least star ac though star ac recommended star ac still fine job yet choose either one two ac consider cost amp x b pricing product first thing consider quality quotient equally high option available market buying ac stuck whether get star ac star ac base decision pricing needle say star ac would much expensive compared star ac since much energy efficient either buy le energy efficient product increase budget also buy star ac cost emi cost emi plan available almost air conditioner available online offline emi store process buying ac cost emi also easy shopping online add emi card preferred payment option pay using card shopping product offline let sale representative help purchase

I work in construction and get a weekly paycheck of $581 and some change if I don’t miss any days. We want to head over sometime in June or July.

1,740oms,"How much for a sandwich? Try $90,000 in lost savings","Survey finds American workers spend an average of $3000 a year on coffee and lunch at work. That is $90k in 30 years!!! Your lunch does not have to cost your health or to cost you a fortune. Invest in a reusable lunch bag!!! There is nothing wrong in carrying your meals in a brown paper bag or in a plastic grocery bag, but you can do much better! American workers spend an alarmingly high amount of their hard earned cash on somewhat average daily expenses, according to a new survey by Accounting Principals. The survey found that 50 percent of the American workforce spends approximately $1000 a year on coffee, or a weekly coffee habit of more than $20. And the spending doesn’t stop there. Two thirds (66 percent) of working Americans buy their lunch instead of packing it, costing them an average of $37 per week — nearly $2,000 a year. Despite these high costs, the survey suggests workers are unclear about the biggest drain to their wallet. When asked which work expense they most want to be reimbursed for by their employer, 42 percent of employees chose commuting costs and only 11 percent chose lunch expenses. However, the average American’s commuting cost is $123 a month or approximately $1500 a year, which is well below the average annual lunch tab of $2000. An insulated bag is reusable, easy to clean and keeps food at temperature especially. The beauty of insulated bags, aside from being reusable, is that they can keep hot food hot and cold food cold for longer than a plain old brown or plastic bag. Toss in an ice pack with your sandwich or leftovers, and if you work somewhere without a fridge or have a long commute your food will survive until lunchtime without spending too much time in the danger zone, where bacteria grow and make your food unsafe to eat. Similarly, insulated bags are easy to clean—just wipe them out with a paper towel and a little soap and water, and they're ready to hit the road again. In search for a good lunch bag, I’ve read a lot of reviews on amazon. What I found out is that many are complaining on annoying snagged or broken zippers and on plastic clips &amp; buckles that snap out.

0,cyee69,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread]( when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: 

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",20,1349,formal posting guideline political topic constitutes v corporate news read commenting sub please,alright everyone look like pretty broad

0,k4j98w,"Canadian electric truck and bus manufacturer to ""IPO"" on NYSE via a merger with $NGA","

Canadian electric truck and bus manufacturer **The Lion Electric Company** said Monday it plans to become a publicly traded company via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp.

The combined company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will have a **valuation of $1.9 billion**. The companies raised $200 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, and hold about $320 million in cash proceeds.

The deal is the latest example of an electric automaker opting to go public via a special purpose acquisition company merger in an aim to access the level of capital needed to become a high-volume vehicle manufacturer. Arrival, Canoo, Fisker, Lordstown Motors and Nikola Corp. have all announced special purpose acquisition company mergers in 2020.

In Lion’s case, the combined net cash will be used to fund the company’s growth, notably the planned construction of a U.S.-based factory and to further develop its advanced battery systems. Lion is evaluating more than 10 potential brownfield plant sites in nine states, including California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin. The company told TechCrunch it plans to pick a site and complete its industrialization plan by the end of the year. Production at this yet-to-be named factory is expected to start in the beginning of 2023.

**Lion is already producing all-electric medium and heavy-duty urban trucks and buses at a 2,500-vehicle-per-year manufacturing facility. Some 300 vehicles are on the road today and the company has plans to deliver 650 trucks and buses in 2021. It even landed a contract with Amazon to supply the e-commerce giant with 10 electric trucks for its “middle mile” operations.**

Completion of the proposed transaction is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2021. Lion is expected to be listed on the NYSE under the new ticker symbol “LEV.” Lion’s CEO and founder Marc Bedard will continue in his role. The combined company will have a board of directors consisting of nine directors, including Bedard, Pierre Larochelle from Power Sustainable as chairman, and five other existing Lion board members, as well as Ian Robertson and Chris Jarratt, who are co-founders of Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities Corp.",15,362,canadian electric truck bus manufacturer ipo nyse via merger nga,canadian electric truck bus manufacturer lion electric company said monday plan become publicly traded company via merger special purpose acquisition company northern genesis acquisition corp combined company listed new york stock exchange valuation billion company raised million private public equity pipe hold million cash proceeds deal latest example electric automaker opting go public via special purpose acquisition company merger aim access level capital needed become high volume vehicle manufacturer arrival canoo fisker lordstown motor nikola corp announced special purpose acquisition company merger lion case combined net cash used fund company growth notably planned construction u based factory develop advanced battery system lion evaluating potential brownfield plant site nine state including california illinois indiana michigan new york ohio oregon pennsylvania washington wisconsin company told techcrunch plan pick site complete industrialization plan end year production yet named factory expected start beginning lion already producing electric medium heavy duty urban truck bus vehicle per year manufacturing facility vehicle road today company plan deliver truck bus even landed contract amazon supply e commerce giant electric truck middle mile operation completion proposed transaction expected occur first quarter lion expected listed nyse new ticker symbol lev lion ceo founder marc bedard continue role combined company board director consisting nine director including bedard pierre larochelle power sustainable chairman five existing lion board member well ian robertson chris jarratt co founder algonquin power amp utility corp

0,k4t0hq,Blackberry announces agreement with Amazon,"Been following BB for a while since they had some projects going with both Amazon and Microsoft.  The stock is having quite a big day so far, up 25% as of this moment.

Today, they announced the following:

&gt;Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB, TSX: BB), a worldwide leader in intelligent security software and services, announced a multi-year, global agreement to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud.  Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.

&gt;BlackBerry IVY addresses a critical data access, collection, and management problem in the automotive industry.  Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data, as well as the challenges of accessing it from within contained vehicle subsystems, limit developers’ abilities to innovate quickly and bring new solutions to market. BlackBerry IVY will solve for these challenges by applying machine learning to that data to generate predictive insights and inferences, making it possible for automakers to offer in-vehicle experiences that are highly personalized and able to take action based on those insights.

&gt;BlackBerry IVY will support multiple vehicle operating systems and multi-cloud deployments in order to ensure compatibility across vehicle models and brands. It will build upon BlackBerry QNX’s capabilities for surfacing and normalizing data from automobiles and AWS’s broad portfolio of services, including capabilities for IoT and machine learning. BlackBerry IVY will run inside a vehicle’s embedded systems, but will be managed and configured remotely from the cloud. As a result, automakers will gain greater visibility into vehicle data, control over who can access it, and edge computing capabilities to optimize how quickly and efficiently the data is processed. With BlackBerry IVY’s integrated capabilities, automakers will be able to deliver new features, functionality, and performance to customers over the lifetime of their cloud-connected vehicles, as well as unlock new revenue streams and business models built on vehicle data.

&gt;For instance, BlackBerry IVY could leverage vehicle data to recognize driver behavior and hazardous conditions such as icy roads or heavy traffic and then recommend that a driver enable relevant vehicle safety features such as traction control, lane-keeping assist, or adaptive cruise control. IVY could then provide automakers with feedback on how and when those safety features are used, allowing them to make targeted investments to improve vehicle performance. Additionally, drivers of electric vehicles could choose to share their car’s battery information with third-party charging networks to proactively reserve a charging connector and tailor charging time according to the driver’s current location and travel plans. BlackBerry IVY could also provide insights to parents of teenage drivers who may choose to receive customized notifications based on insights from vehicle sensors when the number of passengers in the vehicle changes, when the driver appears to be texting, distracted, or not observing speed limits, or when the vehicle occupancy level rises above the parents’ desired safety threshold. Similarly, parents of infants could receive a reminder to engage the child safety lock when the vehicle detects a child in the rear seat.

&gt;BlackBerry IVY will enable automakers to compress the timeline to build, deploy, and monetize new in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple vehicle brands and models. Instead of investing in one-off solutions that conform to the unique engineering of different vehicle models (as they do today), automakers using BlackBerry IVY will be able to leverage different types of data as common building blocks for new services that could work across a range of models. Automakers will be able to use the platform’s application programming interfaces (APIs) to share data and outputs with their software development teams, giving them the ability to innovate, while also protecting customer privacy and security by controlling whom can access vehicle and app data and at what level of detail.

&gt;In addition, BlackBerry IVY will make it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate creation of new offerings that deliver improved vehicle performance, reduced costs for maintenance and repairs, and added convenience. For instance, by analyzing real-time performance data, automakers could recognize the first signs of potentially faulty parts, deploy code to identify affected vehicles, notify impacted drivers, and perform targeted recalls. Automakers will be able to remotely deploy and update the software from the platform’s Cloud Console (a web interface for managing BlackBerry IVY) to continuously improve the functionality of the system.   

&gt;“Data and connectivity are opening new avenues for innovation in the automotive industry, and BlackBerry and AWS share a common vision to provide automakers and developers with better insights so that they can deliver new services to consumers,” said John Chen, Executive Chairman and CEO, BlackBerry. “This software platform promises to bring an era of invention to the in-vehicle experience and help create new applications, services, and opportunities without compromising safety, security, or customer privacy.  We are pleased to expand our relationship with AWS to execute this vision and deliver BlackBerry IVY.”

&gt;“AWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user’s needs and preferences,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.”

0,k5079x,Lululemon Analysis (NASDAQ: LULU),"**Business Overview**

Lululemon is a popular clothing brand that designs and distributes apparel. The company relies on suppliers and manufacturers to make their apparel. Lululemon also sells fitness-related accessories (headbands, yoga mats, etc). In the company’s 10-k, the word “sweat” is quoted, referencing the company’s goal to build a community of people through living the “sweatlife.”

Historically, Lululemon’s typical customers are women or people with a connection to fitness. Fitness is often referred to in the company’s 10-k.

Lululemon is extremely popular among women and there are companies trying to copy them. Lululemon references Nike, Under Armour, Adidas, Gap (Athleta), and Victoria Secret’s Sport Collection.

Lululemon operates 491 stores in 17 countries. This is an increase of 128 stores since 2016. The company added 51 stores in 2019 through 2020 alone.

Lululemon also recently acquired [Mirror](, an at-home fitness startup. This is an interesting acquisition and it’ll be interesting to see how Mirror is implemented alongside Lululemon’s mission and what it means for the rest of the business.

**Competitive Advantages**

1. **Brand**  
Lululemon has a strong brand among consumers. This competitive advantage could be thought of as similar to Nike’s competitive advantage of having one of the strongest brands in the world. Everyone in the world knows Nike. Most women know Lululemon and possibly more and more men will know Lululemon in the future. Brand can be a strong competitive advantage but can be difficult to pinpoint. Brands can have a strong impact on the competitive advantage of a business when other companies (Athleta) are trying to copy Lululemon but compete on price instead of brand or quality.
2. **Economies of Scale**  
Because Lululemon is a big business with relationships with suppliers and manufacturers across the world, the company can negotiate cost savings due to its scale. Lululemon can also employ operating leverage through all of its stores and through its direct to consumer revenue stream.
3. **Ecosystem**  
This idea is more out there and probably unrealistic, but Lululemon could have an opportunity to build a community of people obsessed with the brand and cultivate an ecosystem or community of people. The acquisition of Mirror shows that management might be trying to expand into other areas adjacent to their core area of fitness apparel. One quote in the 10-k is “We have a vision to be the experiential brand that ignites a community of people through sweat, grow, and connect, which we call ""living the sweatlife."" So if Lululemon continues to try and expand into other areas similar to fitness, this could be a glimpse into the future of what Lululemon will look like in 5 years.

**Tailwinds**

1. **Digital Fitness**  
COVID-19 has accelerated at-home workout equipment (Peloton) and other startups. More consumers will purchase fitness apparel and could be brought into the Lululemon fan club and purchase a whole closet of leggings, jackets, headbands, or anything else. Digital fitness is a massive market and Lululemon could benefit greatly from this trend by selling more fitness apparel or selling more Mirror equipment.
2. **Athleisure**  
This is more of an obvious trend but worth pointing out. Supposedly, Lululemon makes some comfortable professional clothing. The athleisure trend could be shifting into offices in the future. The professional attire market is also big and even just taking a small slice of this market could be meaningful.
3. **Direct to Consumer (DTC)**  
One of the most attractive things about Lululemon is its shift to selling products online. This DTC strategy doesn’t rely on stores, has higher margins, and a high growth rate. Many apparel companies are benefitting from the DTC trend. This trend forces companies to rely more on Facebook and Google for advertising but companies can develop a brand image and can own the relationship with consumers from start to finish. For a picture of the DTC revenue line for Lululemon, check out the financial section below.

**Financials**

1. **Company-operated stores**  
Grew revenue from $1.7bn in 2016 to $2.5bn in 2020. This is a respectable CAGR of 10.1%. This segment also has operating income margin of \~27% over the past two years. This segment has also had improving margins since 2018.
2. **Direct to Consumer**  
Grew revenue from \~$450 million in 2016 to $1.1bn in 2020, an impressive revenue CAGR of 25.0%. This is the most attractive revenue line in my opinion. This segment boasts operating margins of \~42% in 2020, an improvement from 38.8% in 2018. If this trend continues and Lululemon can benefit from operating leverage and pricing power, this revenue segment’s operating margin could continue to improve.
3. **Other**  
This line item is sales to outlets, temporary locations, wholesale accounts, and other sales funnels. Revenue grew from $186 million in 2016 to $340 million in 2020. This a CAGR of 15.6%. Still respectable but not meaningful for a Lululemon investment thesis. This segment has operating income of \~21%.

Lululemon had total revenue of roughly $4bn with total operating income close to $900 million. Total revenue is growing \~21%.

**Future Questions**

If I were to invest in Lululemon, here are some questions I’d want to answer before investing my own capital.

1. **Brand**  
Lululemon may put off some people because the company isn’t accepting of all body styles or all groups of people. This could harm the potential customer base and could turn off many potential customers.
2. **International Expansion**  
Lululemon has done a good job expanding stores across Europe, China, and the rest of the Asia Pacific region. This could be a huge boost to their revenue and bottom line. From 2019 to 2020, Lululemon opened 51 stores across the world, with 19 coming from Canada and the United States and the remaining openings coming from the rest of the world.

**Conclusion**

Lululemon is an attractive company and is actually a 100-bagger since December 2008. Lululemon most likely won’t be a 100-bagger or even a 10-bagger since the company has a market cap of \~$48bn. I know many people (both men and women) who are big fans of Lululemon and oftentimes the best investments have the most dedicated and loyal consumers. Lululemon might fit this bill.

0,k540ht,December market meltdown?,"
Hello all,

I want to highlight a few points that I have observed in the markets in the past couple of weeks.

1) $908B stimulus bill

2) Corporate spreads

3) Market volatility in December

I will try to keep it in broad terms and as always, please feel free to ask questions in the comments.

1) Legislators proposed a bipartisan stimulus bill of roughly $908B. 

At this point, it's not that surprising that the amount is lower than the initial ranges of $1.5tn - $3tn since there was a large divide in the Congress with regards to the size and allocation of capital.

The news drove stock indices higher and also the Treasury yields higher, specifically 30-year treasury.

  

![img](7p9v60zvmp261)

I think this is one of a series of fiscal spending that will be coming in the next year or two. 

The 30-year yield has declined in recent weeks significantly. I have initiated a short position on 30-year futures this week. I think the upcoming vaccine news along with economic recovery in 2021 will serve as catalysts for a steady steepening in the yield curve.

2) Corporate spreads show that we are in an abnormally tight market.

If you remember from the latest Market Commentary on 11/23/2020 (link below), I mentioned that we are entering the solvency phase of the corona crisis.

[\_commentary\_treasury\_cuts\_fed\_funding\_tsla/](

I was worried that a slow economic recovery may push more companies to go bankrupt due to a protracted recovery. The reason was that if a restaurant had large amounts of interest payment coming due, it'll miss the payment and default. 

However, the total number of bankruptcies and loan default rates have been relatively subdued due to programs like Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), lower borrowing rates, and favorable economic outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](ymulu82hip261 ""Spec means speculative grade, meaning low bond ratings. "")

I have seen more and more companies are now able to reorganize their balance sheets to extend maturities, increase leverage at lower rates compared to March highs, and reduce their debt service payments.

A restaurant that was expected to miss its December 2020 interest payment would have already refinanced its existing debt, lowered the near-term interest payments and extended out the maturity. This is all possible due to the highly stabilized capital markets.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](avaw2i9xnp261)

![img](ktmbvlwvnp261)

A below-investment-grade company can now refinance their debt at 430 bps (basis points) spread to Treasury compared to more than 10% we have seen back in March. 

In effect, the pandemic wiped out those companies whose balance sheets were extremely-levered, but many companies got lifelines from the government and those who stayed alive were able to reorganize their balance sheets to be in a healthier position.

Throw a vaccine on top of that and you will be out of the whole solvency crisis sooner than later.

So far, it's all nice and rosy. But what's important to note is that this crisis is different than your usual ones.

Normally, we would expect to see a deleveraging in a recession, companies reducing debt.

This time, however, the total corporate debt outstanding has actually increased by wide margin. 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](n73wgcwwpp261 ""Shaded areas are recessions."")

What I'm trying to get at is that we've got two key trends happening: rising corporate debt levels but tightening corporate spreads. Generally, you would expect those two to happen at a market top, so this crisis is different and we should keep that in mind as we piece together the whole picture (remember the Mosaic Theory, from this link [\_philosophy\_plz\_read\_this/]( ).

&amp;#x200B;

3) Market may be volatile in December due to a few reasons. 

First, investors try to lower their tax returns for 2020 by selling their losing positions in December, which creates market volatility.

But I wouldn't expect a market meltdown like the one we've seen in December 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](89yvvhjxqp261 ""S&amp;P 500 Index"")

That was primarily driven by Fed monetary tightening, reducing the balance sheet and raising interest rates. 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](kvgod2d3rp261 ""V2Y00 is the 10-year Treasury yield"")

&amp;#x200B;

![img](imdq1g17rp261 ""Reducing the Fed balance sheet "")

However, I am more worried now than I have been in recent weeks.

Second, as I said before, we are priced for an optimal outcome: vaccine, fast economic recovery, fiscal stimulus, lack of trade-war, and so on. If you had to bet on the next market move, you would probably guess that a negative news headline will tank the market more than a positive news headline will shoot up the market. But again, I wouldn't expect to see a meltdown like the one in December 2018.

Lastly,  I have noticed that the VIX index (volatility index) has moved in a positive correlation with the S&amp;P 500. 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](by9dun0zrp261)

We have seen this a couple of times back in February just before the March crisis and in August just before the September drop.

While this is not a perfect indicator, it is one of the pieces of information that we have to make our decisions. So keep this in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

The bottom line is that as we are entering the year-end, I would be more cautious than optimistic.

For those bond investors especially, I would suggest to be more concerned about the markets right now. HY spread of 430 bps right now is not attractive at all and you are not being compensated for the credit risks.

For stock investors, I would also suggest to be careful but do not panic when the market drops. A good idea is to implement hedging strategies in the short term by buying SPY puts.

**Trading plan**

1) Bullish on tech stocks.

I'm still leaning bullish on broader digital consumer and enterprise spending. Favorite risk/reward plays at the moment are PDD, STNE, FVRR, FUTU, BABA, W, and SEDG.

2) Bearish on long-end yield curve.

I continue to think yield curve steepening will play out in the medium to long-term (6 months - 2 years). I have initiated a short position on 30-year Treasury futures (ZB).

3) Bullish on gold.

As dollar gets weaker, gold will likely gain a steam upwards and inflation gauges will not only put upward pressure on the 10-yr treasury yield but also on gold as well.

I have initiated a call option on GLD. Given the recent drop in gold, I believe we are in a better risk/reward position to enter into the trade.",3,1002,december market meltdown,hello want highlight point observed market past couple week b stimulus bill corporate spread market volatility december try keep broad term always please feel free ask question comment legislator proposed bipartisan stimulus bill roughly b point surprising amount lower initial range tn tn since large divide congress regard size allocation capital news drove stock index higher also treasury yield higher specifically year treasury img p v zvmp think one series fiscal spending coming next year two year yield declined recent week significantly initiated short position year future week think upcoming vaccine news along economic recovery serve catalyst steady steepening yield curve corporate spread show abnormally tight market remember latest market commentary link mentioned entering solvency phase corona crisis commentary treasury cut fed funding tsla worried slow economic recovery may push company go bankrupt due protracted recovery reason restaurant large amount interest payment coming due miss payment default however total number bankruptcy loan default rate relatively subdued due program like paycheck protection program ppp lower borrowing rate favorable economic outlook amp x b img ymulu hip spec mean speculative grade meaning low bond rating seen company able reorganize balance sheet extend maturity increase leverage lower rate compared march high reduce debt service payment restaurant expected miss december interest payment would already refinanced existing debt lowered near term interest payment extended maturity possible due highly stabilized capital market amp x b img avaw xnp img ktmbvlwvnp grade company refinance debt bps basis point spread treasury compared seen back march effect pandemic wiped company whose balance sheet extremely levered many company got lifeline government stayed alive able reorganize balance sheet healthier position throw vaccine top whole solvency crisis sooner later far nice rosy important note crisis different usual one normally would expect see deleveraging recession company reducing debt time however total corporate debt outstanding actually increased wide margin amp x b img n wgcwwpp shaded area recession trying get got two key trend happening rising corporate debt level tightening corporate spread generally would expect two happen market top crisis different keep mind piece together whole picture remember mosaic theory link philosophy plz read amp x b market may volatile december due reason first investor try lower tax return selling losing position december creates market volatility expect market meltdown like one seen december amp x b img yvvhjxqp amp p index primarily driven fed monetary tightening reducing balance sheet raising interest rate amp x b img kvgod rp v year treasury yield amp x b img imdq g rp reducing fed balance sheet however worried recent week second said priced optimal outcome vaccine fast economic recovery fiscal stimulus lack trade war bet next market move would probably guess negative news headline tank market positive news headline shoot market expect see meltdown like one december lastly noticed vix index volatility index moved positive correlation amp p amp x b img dun zrp seen couple time back february march crisis august september drop perfect indicator one piece information make decision keep mind amp x b bottom line entering year end would cautious optimistic bond investor especially would suggest concerned market right hy spread bps right attractive compensated credit risk stock investor would also suggest careful panic market drop good idea implement hedging strategy short term buying spy put trading plan bullish tech stock still leaning bullish broader digital consumer enterprise spending favorite risk reward play moment pdd stne fvrr futu baba w sedg bearish long end yield curve continue think yield curve steepening play medium long term month year initiated short position year treasury future zb bullish gold dollar get weaker gold likely gain steam upwards inflation gauge put upward pressure yr treasury yield also gold well initiated call option gld given recent drop gold believe better risk reward position enter trade
0,k4odfk,"How some analysts are trying to screw you, a short analysis of J.P. Morgan's NKLA analyst","So, the GM MoU with NKLA gets published yesterday and the stock tanks.
This is the last coffin in the nail for NKLA, they are completely done for.

Yet, we hear our lord and savior Paul Coster(J.P. Morgan analyst) say this,

{On Wall Street, two analysts who cover Nikola disagreed on what the scaled-down GM agreement means. J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster maintains an overweight rating on the stock.

""We think this is a positive outcome for Nikola over the medium to longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck initiative and avoid the distraction and [capital expenditures] associated with the Badger,"" Coster said in an investor note.}-[link.](;_v=1&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sp=1&amp;_v=1&amp;theme=2&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en)

In October he said this,
{J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster calls it “a compelling strategy.”However, Coster also points out Nikola’s near-term success hinges on GM signing on the dotted line.“We think the GM partnership deal is the most important near-term catalyst,” Coster said. “Failure to consummate the GM deal would be a fatal blow for the Badger initiative, but a serious blow to the more important Truck initiative too, in our view. The fuel station partnership announcement is less important, in our view, though a potential validation of the company that could resonate with investors. Pending completion of the five Nikola Tre trucks could be a boost to credibility, obviously… For now, the GM partnership is a stress-test for the company.”Coster remains positive on Nikola and keeps an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating along with a bullish $41 price target.}-[link.](
Did you just read that? He has a price target of $41. 

Again, what he said yesterday kinda completely contradicts with what he said in October.

2 years ago he have had such a [low rating(screenshot of a screenshot)]( that I find it surprising that he has almost come to [3 stars.](

Of course, he probably has inherent interest to see NKLA go above its current price. For this he doesn’t give a f**k if people buy into his arguments and jump on board on this stock.

I guess he wants just a dead cat bounce so that he could save his ass and make sure that retail investors become the ultimate bagholders of this company.

There are many other analysts like that in the Street and I don’t know how they remain in business for so long. But my main point is that be careful before you jump into a stock. 

Some of you probably just see an average analyst price target, see a stock is undervalued or overvalued and jump to trade it. I mean according to analyst estimates NKLA would be a kind of a good deal in this overvalued market(see PLTR price targets, it’s hilarious). But we all know that this company's stock is ultimately going to $0(probably within next year).

0,k4oddh,Airbnb seeks valuation of up to $35 billion in its IPO,"Source : [](

&amp;#x200B;

KEY POINTS:

* Airbnb filed an updated S-1 on Tuesday ahead of its expected IPO later this month.
* The company said it expects to price between $44 and $50 per share.
* That would give Airbnb a valuation of up to $35 billion, a rise from its peak private valuation of $31 billion.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 

Airbnb plans to price at $44 to $50 per share in its IPO, giving it a valuation of up to $35 billion on a fully diluted basis, according to a new filing it submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. The company aims to raise about $2.5 billion in the initial public offering. Existing investors seek to sell $96 million worth of stock in the IPO.

Airbnb’s last private valuation was $18 billion, [after it raised $2 billion in debt]( earlier this year as the company struggled in the early months of the [coronavirus pandemic]( That was nearly half its peak private valuation ($31 billion) from 2017.

The company will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker “ABNB.” It’s expected to hold its IPO later this month. Airbnb’s roadshow, where it makes its pitch to investors, will start Tuesday.

Airbnb released its first S-1 last month, reporting net income of $219 million on $1.34 billion in revenue in the third quarter of this year, down about 19% from the year before. Like most travel companies, Airbnb has seen a drop in business due to the [Covid-19 pandemic](

But after cutting about 25% of its staff, or about 1,900 employees, in May, Airbnb saw its business quickly bounce back later in the year. That was thanks to a surge in rentals in rural areas as people looked for safe escapes amid the pandemic. The company was originally expected to go public in the first half of the year, but the crisis upended those plans.

But with markets ripping higher on positive vaccine news and President-elect Joe Biden’s election win last month, it’s a good environment for companies to go public now.

In addition to Airbnb, DoorDash, the maker of the popular food delivery app, is also expected to hold an IPO this month.

According to a report by CNBC on Tuesday, CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink said bitcoin has “caught the attention” of many people and that the cryptocurrency market was still relatively small compared to others.

Speaking to the former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney at the Council on Foreign Relations on Tuesday, Fink said the nascent cryptocurrency asset class can possibly “evolve” into a global market asset, CNBC said.

According to the report, Fink also said having a digital currency has a real impact on the U.S. dollar, making it less relevant on a global scale for international holders of dollar-based assets. He also raised the question: “Does it change the need for the dollar as a reserve currency?”

I'm assuming they will re-design Slack into threads, where users can tag in colleagues and start a mini-chat instance that runs parallel to the conversation in the email exchange. The  idea is to permit quick discussions of questions and clarifications to occur where they have the most context.

0,k3unr7,TSLA: Get ready to cash out from the largest ongoing pump and dump in history,"Ok, so TSLA will be included in S&amp;P 500 in Dec 21. Old news. Around $100B(almost 1/5th of its market cap) of TSLA would need to be purchased(some active funds may have already purchased) based on current stock price.

The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&amp;P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Berkshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!

Today they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.

[This is what happened when Yahoo was included(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&amp;P 500's size). Although I believe TSLA will rise again after some time, unlike Yahoo.](

After the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to front-run the index investors.

Also, the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla’s inclusion, investors said. (this paragraph copied straight from wsj)

So, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.

Also, remember NIO etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.

I don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am still holding it) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer.

Some special points to remember:

* TSLA already jumped 40% after its inclusion news broke out and had been steadily climbing before it due to rumour that it will be included in the index and Softbank's trade earlier this year.
* TSLA can issue more shares, especially in this valuation. I mean why wouldn't they, lol.

I know posts that say anything negative about TSLA gets downvoted but be careful about your TSLA shares or options!

0,k52olv,Yet another line of questions about leveraged ETFs (x-post r/FIRE r/personalfinance),"Hello, I know people post frequently on reddit asking about leveraged ETFs. I have gone through and read through many of these posts, as well as other resources, and have a few remaining questions.

&amp;#x200B;

A summary of what I've learned:

\-leveraged ETFs attempt to create an index that tracks a given underlying index, multiplied by a given factor, over a given period of time (usually daily). they do not have perfect tracking, but it's generally pretty good

\-volatility drag is amplified in these leveraged funds, and can cause them to go down significantly in value even when the underlying fund is standing still, or sometimes even going up

\-when the underyling fund goes down, obviously the leveraged fund goes way down. for example, if the underlying fund for a 3X leveraged ETF were to go down 33% in one day (unprecented but not impossible), the leveraged ETF would go to 0

\-so leveraged ETFs are generally a battle between magniyging the average positive gains of their underlying fund, vs extra fees and magnified volatility drag

&amp;#x200B;

This was by far the most useful article I read about them: [](

&amp;#x200B;

Concerns/Questions:

\-How do these funds work under the hood? I read an article on investopedia that says they use ""derivatives, including index futures, equity swaps, and index options"". I read about each of these in turn, but am still confused. It seems like they're borrowing the extra money to invest, but I don't get from whom, or how they pay it back.

\-From the article I linked, it seems like leveraged funds do, on average, return higher than their underlying tracked indexes (even after increased expense ratios, which run about 1% for leveraged ETFs). A conclusion of the article was that the ideal leverage ratio varies with the fund and time period, but that 2X is a good ballpark for the sweet spot with the S&amp;P 500 and similar funds over a wide range of historical data. What are we paying for this increased average return? Is it just massively increased risk? Or is there something else I'm missing?

\-Although leveraged ETFs seem to outperform the underlying funds they track, they normally track only moderately volatile indices, to avoid excessive volatily drag. How do they compare to other unleveraged mutual funds and ETFs that are riskier and return higher than the S&amp;P500, such as SWSSX (small cap index fund)?

\-It seems like most leveraged funds do not include dividends. Does this negate the advantage that such funds possess?

\-How do these funds compare to simply borrowing extra money to invest, either through a line of credit, or investing on margin? I looked into both of these options. I was dissuaded by the high rates and short terms for lines of credit. For investing on the margin, I was dissuaded by the danger of your margin lender calling your debt on a sigificant market downturn, forcing you to sell at the worst time. But again, maybe I'm missing something?

&amp;#x200B;

Ideas/Other Questions

\-the key with leveraged ETFs seems to be avoiding volatility in the underlying fund. Are there any leveraged ETFs that track a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds together? My understanding is that these tend to be much less volatile, with still reasonable returns. If these don't exist, would it be possible to create one of these yourself by combining leveraged ETFs of stock and bond indexes, respectively, and frequently rebalancing? Would you be eaten up by capital gains with this method? (Admittedly, rebalancing this frequently would probably be a big pain in the butt either way)

\-although most leveraged ETFs seek to multiply the daily returns of their underlying funds, it seems there are some that track longer time periods. For example, SPLX is a leveraged ETF with 2x the monthly returns of the S&amp;P500. Unfortunately this fund is no longer available, but maybe there are similar ones out there? Would weekly, monthly, or even yearly reset leveraged ETFs be strictly better because of the lessening volatiliy of the undelying fund caused by averaging over longer periods of time?",11,663,yet another line question leveraged etf x post r fire r personalfinance,hello know people post frequently reddit asking leveraged etf gone read many post well resource remaining question amp x b summary learned leveraged etf attempt create index track given underlying index multiplied given factor given period time usually daily perfect tracking generally pretty good volatility drag amplified leveraged fund cause go significantly value even underlying fund standing still sometimes even going underyling fund go obviously leveraged fund go way example underlying fund x leveraged etf go one day unprecented impossible leveraged etf would go leveraged etf generally battle magniyging average positive gain underlying fund v extra fee magnified volatility drag amp x b far useful article read amp x b concern question fund work hood read article investopedia say use derivative including index future equity swap index option read turn still confused seems like borrowing extra money get pay back article linked seems like leveraged fund average return higher underlying tracked index even increased expense ratio run leveraged etf conclusion article ideal leverage ratio varies fund time period x good ballpark sweet spot amp p similar fund wide range historical data paying increased average return massively increased risk something else missing although leveraged etf seem outperform underlying fund track normally track moderately volatile index avoid excessive volatily drag compare unleveraged mutual fund etf riskier return higher amp p swssx small cap index fund seems like leveraged fund include dividend negate advantage fund posse fund compare simply borrowing extra money either line credit margin looked option dissuaded high rate short term line credit margin dissuaded danger margin lender calling debt sigificant market downturn forcing sell worst time maybe missing something amp x b idea question key leveraged etf seems avoiding volatility underlying fund leveraged etf track diversified portfolio stock bond together understanding tend much le volatile still reasonable return exist would possible create one combining leveraged etf stock bond index respectively frequently rebalancing would eaten capital gain method admittedly rebalancing frequently would probably big pain butt either way although leveraged etf seek multiply daily return underlying fund seems track longer time period example splx leveraged etf x monthly return amp p unfortunately fund longer available maybe similar one would weekly monthly even yearly reset leveraged etf strictly better lessening volatiliy undelying fund caused averaging longer period time

0,k3un41,"Passive vs active investing, 2 year experiment","In December 2018 I sold a business for mid 7 figures. Being burnt out after 15 years I did not intend to jump straight back into industry so decided instead to test an active vs passive investing strategy for a few years.

I was a die hard efficient market / boglehead, but always enjoyed the process of stock picking, and being a hubristic \*\*\*\* decided on 50% SPY and 50% for a stock picking retail account. My background is private equity and I am comfortable doing deep dive research, building DCF models etc etc.

50% went into SPY on 2nd Dec 2018 at 263. I did nothing to this account since. Dividends were auto-reinvested. 

In the active account, I built a portfolio of small and micro cap stocks focussing on sectors I know well. The portfolio held 14 stocks after 21 months. A few have been turned over since with new ones added but generally the approach has been to buy and hold good businesses. Dividends were auto-reinvested. I spent 15 hours a week on research and analysis, so about **1380 hours** since Dec 2018.

Since 3rd December 2018:

*SPY with dividends reinvested has returned 21.5% annualised.*

*The active portfolio has returned 25% annualised (incidentally with a higher sharpe ratio / lower max drawdown.* It has delivered in raw terms an additional $90,000 over the passive fund. Divide by 1380 hours = $65/hr. Worth it? Sure. If you enjoy something, and can do it ad-hoc from your own home, being paid $65/hr is a pretty good result, especially as that figure will compound over time, assuming continued results. I can share the portfolio and results on request.

Beating the market is quite addictive of course. A boglehead would say 2 years proves nothing with regards to luck vs skill and I would agree.

**Summary**

* AbCellera has filed its preliminary prospectus for its IPO; shares have yet to be priced but the company is looking to raise a proposed \~$200mn.
* AbCellera is a Vancouver-based AI-powered drug discovery platform with backing from Peter Thiel, known for its leading platform and COVID-19 treatment in partnership with Eli Lilly.
* Its most successful antibody (LY-Cov555)/bamlanivimab has recently been granted emergency approval by Health Canada and the FDA - expected to receive &gt;$100mn in royalties.
* Its unique, proprietary business model and experienced management &amp; board positions AbCellera for long-term success.
* We see AbCellera as a play on LY-Cov555 success and the near-term delivery of other antibody candidates, with the downside of potential headline risk.
* The Vancouver-based AI drug discovery platform that has caught the eye of investors including Peter Thiel for its leading platform and the development of its COVID-19 treatment with Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), AbCellera Biologics Inc.

## AbCellera Business Model

AbCellera provides drug developers with a platform to find antibody candidates for drug research. Its AI-powered full-stack platform searches and analyzes real-world immune system databases to find leads that are subsequently used for clinical R&amp;D. Unlike its competitors, AbCellera operates along the entire value chain from sourcing to the delivery of antibody candidates; this solves the existing problem of either inadequate/outdated discovery approaches or using multiple fragmented solutions (costly and inefficient).

AbCellera’s revenue is split into three streams - these streams include:

1. Licensing / Research Fees (68% of revenue, 9 months ended September 30, 2020): payments for technology access and performing research
2. Milestone Payments (32% of revenue): downstream payments for clinical/commercial milestones. Note: Only one program, LY-CoV555 with Eli Lilly, to date has resulted in milestone payments
3. Royalties: royalties on net sales of any approved therapeutics. Note: As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has yet to receive any royalties. Royalties generally will range from low-single digit for non-COVID targets to mid-teens to mid-twenties for COVID targets

As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs either completed, in-progress, or under contract, with a few public key partnerships below. Some of AbCellera’s recent, public partnerships are as follows:

*Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY)* \- On March 12, 2020, AbCellera and Lilly announced to co-develop antibody therapies for the treatment of COVID-19, the potential treatment LY-CoV555 accelerated due to Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. As part of the agreement, AbCellera received an upfront payment of $25mn and is entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $29mn of milestone payments. As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has received $8mn related to LY-CoV555 and is eligible to receive royalties on aggregate sales (including Lilly’s $375mn and $312.5mn contracts with the US government and US Army Contracting Command respectively).

*Invetx* \- On February 23, 2020, AbCellera originally entered a multi-year, multi-target partnership agreement with Invetx. Based on the successful delivery of research programs under the original agreement, the scope of the collaboration has been expanded to include multiple new targets over several years on November 19, 2020.

*Kodiak Sciences (NASDAQ: KOD) -* After a successful collaboration in 2016, AbCellera and Kodiak Sciences announced a new partnership on October 29. 2020 to generate therapeutic antibody candidates in ophthalmology.

*IGM Biosciences (NASDAQ: IGMS) -* AbCellera and IGM Biosciences announced on September 24, 2020, that they have entered into a multi-year, multi-target strategic research collaboration and license agreement to facilitate the discovery and development of novel IgM antibodies.

AbCellera’s business strategy (per prospectus) is focused on (i) using the drug discovery platform to unlock new opportunities for therapeutic antibody development; and (ii) partners access the platform to eliminate the extended delays and costs associated with setting up drug discovery capabilities.

## Recent Developments / Company Timeline

1. In March 2020, AbCellera entered into a discovery partnership with Eli Lilly and Company, to perform discovery research for a number of targets for Lilly that will result in antibodies for Lilly to develop and potentially commercialize.
2. In April 2020, AbCellera entered into a multi-year agreement with the Canadian government’s Strategic Innovation Fund, and CAD $175.6mn ($125.6mn) was committed by the Government of Canada, of which &gt;$110mn remains and is intended to be used to build a GMP facility.
3. In June 2020, LY-Cov555 moved to first in-inhuman testing and progressed to Phase 3 clinical trials.
4. In November 2020, LY-CoV555 was granted emergency-use authorization by the FDA and Health Canada. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, AbCellera received an aggregate of $8.0mn upon the satisfaction of clinical milestones by Lilly.
5. In November 2020, AbCellera acquired Trianni for $90.0mn. Trianni develops transgenic mice that provide a source of fully-human antibodies for therapeutic antibody candidates. Trianni mouse technology will allow AbCellera to generate more high-quality antibodies against difficult targets and improve the speed of the discovery programs. In addition to strategic value, Trianni also generates revenues through mouse sales, platform licensing fees and associated downstream milestone payments.

*Company Timeline: AbCellera has demonstrated consistent growth and has generated positive operating cash flow cumulatively since its inception in 2012.*

## Management Team &amp; BOD Overview

AbCellera’s management team is highly experienced with significant experience in related industries. AbCellera has also continued to bolster its board of directors with high-profile names including Peter Thiel (Palantir, Paypal, Facebook) and John Montalbano (CPPIB) ahead of its IPO.

With its recent additions, we view AbCellera’s management team and board as a strength.

## Financial Analysis

In Part II of this analysis, we will take a deeper dive into the valuation, pro forma financials, capital structure, and go-forward expectations for the business. The below provides a brief overview of the financials. We view the company to be financially healthy, given the low capitalization and limited contractual obligations, supported by continued licensing/research revenue and royalties from LY-CoV555 and other contracts.

**Revenue** has grown at a 109% CAGR since 2014, primarily driven by increased research fees (driven by the number and quality of programs under contract) and milestone fees (AbCellera received its first milestone fee in 2020 from Lilly of $8mn). September 2020 YTD revenue was \~$25mn (\~$30mn pro forma for Trianni acquisition).

**Key Revenue Drivers** in the near term will include milestone payments on existing contracts and royalty payments from Lilly for LY-CoV555. The company is eligible for royalties in low- to mid-teens for aggregate sales below $125mn and mid-teens to mid-twenties on aggregate sales above $125mn. Assuming a 20% royalty on existing US contracts (\~$690mn), this would drive an incremental $137mn of revenue (excluding an additional $21mn available through milestone payments).

**Liquidity** will be bolstered by the equity raise, with the use of proceeds used to continue making investments in R&amp;D, building its business development team and other general corporate purposes. AbCellera has more than $8mn of total future contractual obligations and commitments (as of September 30, 2020), which can be financed through cash on hand or other debt (AbCellera has demonstrated access to bank and private placement debt).

**Capital Structure** will look significantly different post-IPO; pro forma for the conversion of \~$80mn of convertible preferred shares and $90mn of convertible notes, AbCellera will have limited leverage on the balance sheet.

## Competitive Environment

AbCellera’s current market position as a full-stack service provider provides meaningful barriers to entry, with its primary competitors providing services at some point along its value chain. The integrated nature of AbCellera’s services (provides integrated services from start to end), in addition to the nature of its AI-platform (interconnection and scale enable AI to continuously become more efficient) is a competitive advantage.

That being said, the life sciences and biotech platform technology market is highly competitive; technical competitors at different stages of AbCellera’s platform in the following fields are detailed below:

Single-cell screening: Berkeley Lights Inc. (NASDAQ: BLI), HiFiBio Inc., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: LGND), and Sphere Fluidics Ltd.

Antibody RepSeq: 10X Genomics Inc. (NASDAQ: TXG), Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. (NASDAQ: ADPT), Atreca Inc (NASDAQ: BCEL). and Distributed Bio Inc.

Bispecific antibody engineering: Abbvie Inc. (NYSE:[ABBV](, Genmab A/S, Merus N.V. and Zymeworks Inc. (NYSE:[ZYME](

Discovery using genetically engineered rodents: Ablexis LLC, Crescendo Biologics Ltd., Harbour Antibodies BV, Kymab Ltd., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: LGND). and RenBio Inc.

In addition, AbCellera competes with a variety of fee-for-service contract research organizations, in most cases using legacy technologies that would compete with one or more steps in AbCellera’s technology stack. Organizations may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems rather than rely on AbCellera’s platform.

## IPO Details

The IPO will be jointly underwritten by Credit Suisse (left lead), Stifel, Berenberg, SVB (healthcare specialist) and BMO Capital Markets. While the IPO has yet to be priced, we expect the IPO to price wide of the latest $12.46 funding round precedents, driven by continued positive news (FDA and Health Canada approval for Bamlanivimab, Trianni acquisition, new contracts, and more). We note the following pricing precedents:

* March 2020: Series A2 preferred shares issued at $12.46/sh
* April 2020: Existing shareholder purchased \~$600k of shares at $11.21/sh
* June 2020: Existing shareholder purchased \~$3mn of shares at $11.21/sh
* October 2020: Granted options to employees, consultants and directors to purchase \~3.6mn shares at a weighted average of $10.51

Assuming a $25/share IPO price (refinements to valuation to come), we expect the fully-diluted share count to be \~39.8mn (\~15.4mn shares outstanding as of September 30 plus \~$8.0mn shares issued as part of IPO plus \~8.1mn of convertible preferreds plus \~4.2mn of convertible notes plus \~4.0mn of options in the money), putting the pro forma market capitalization at \~$1.0bn.

## The Bottom Line

Our Investment Thesis: we think that AbCellera is well-positioned to grow as a leader in an attractive, lucrative, and fragmented industry, supported by a strong management team and board. As the Company continues to find success, AbCellera will transition from its position today as a company heavily dependent on near-term binary outcomes (reliance on a few partnerships with milestone payments for revenue) to a more stable (royalty cash flows) company with significant upside for growth.

**The Positives:**

* World-class management &amp; shareholder support
   * *Experienced executive team with deep experience (STEMCELL, Precision NanoSystems)*
   * *Strong and supportive long-term minority shareholders and experience board*
* Leading industry platform with barriers to entry
   * *Full-stack solution is a unique value proposition vs. its competitors.*
   * *Data generated through discovery partnerships provide the basis for training AI modules that yield new insights into antibody responses; with each research program, the platform becomes more effective and efficient*
   * *Benefits from natural antibody optimization vs “genetically made” antibodies from legacy systems*
* Scalable business with a large addressable market
   * *AI platform and partnership strategy enables organic growth with minimal funding requirements*
   * *In 2019, antibody-based therapeutics accounted for over $140 billion in sales worldwide and represented five of the top 10 selling therapeutics.*
* The business model enables diversified revenue long-term stream
   * *Three pronged revenue stream: research, milestone payments, royalties.*
   * *Revenue to stabilize as therapeutics are approved and come to market (e.g. LY-CoV555)*
* COVID upside
   * *Bamlanivimab (Eli Lilly collaboration, LY-CoV555) approved for treatment by Health Canada and the FDA*
   * *Royalties and future milestone payments to drive near-term revenue growth*

**The Risks:**

* **Headline Risk:** milestone payments and earnings are dependent on unknown, binary outcomes (excluding royalties).
   * Timing and quantum of LY-Cov555 royalties are unknown, delays or other negative developments would limit near-term upside
   * Lack of transparency - disclosure of partnerships is at the mercy of AbCellera’s customers, with little to no control over public disclosure from partners.
* **Customer Risk:** AbCellera’s revenue stream relies on its partnerships as if it cannot maintain and expand current partnerships or failure to address the needs of customers could impact the market acceptance of the platform.
   * As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs that were either completed, in progress or under contract, including 71 with the potential for milestone and royalty payments.

0,k4ue6o,Best way to coax basic investor information out of a dishonest startup CEO?,"I was interim CFO and common stockholder of a very promising startup slowly but surely inching toward profitability, and the startup had recently finished a capital raise from over 50 investors. One day, the founder (and CEO/Chairman) hired a new CEO to replace himself without talking to me.

Right away, the new CEO lied to me about a number of finance-related things one would reasonably expect a CFO to know (Really? Still blows my mind.) and tried to pressure me into structuring his comp payments to evade payroll taxes. Not wanting to be associated with blatant dishonesty, I quit very quickly.

Fast forward a year, and the CEO and his associates burned through all the cash and desperately entered a preferred stock investment from a venture fund with a large liquidation preference and control, resulting in massive dilution and decimation of the common shareholders' value.

To date, the CEO has avoided any questions regarding basic financial information and the exact terms of the preferred stock deal and claimed (when I caught him off guard with a surprise call) that counsel advised him against disclosing anything beyond the vague information disclosed. The only information disclosed on a monthly basis is revenue (with subpar growth) and headcount.

Having worked with many small companies and startups (and naively investing in small caps back in college) and mentally constructing a current picture from last year to now, it's quite clear that something is wrong, and that the new capital will be spent in no time. Why else would the CEO go almost silent and avoid questions, and why else would counsel advise management to ""shut up"" about simple investor requests?

**TL;DR:** CEO of startup refuses to provide investors with basic financial information and key terms of a highly dilutive investment, and I'm afraid it will fail in no time. Startups fail all the time, but this one was unique among many I've worked with, so it's especially frustrating that something so promising would be destroyed by management.  As an investor, I'd love to find a way to rescue the company, my investment and 50+ other investors' investments, but concrete information is lacking:

* How do I convince the CEO to disclose basic financial information and terms of the preferred stock to me and fellow investors? Perhaps putting them on the spot by BCC'ing the other investors would work?
* There has been some talk of legal action to force at least a return of investment. Any success or failure stories with private startups?
* Not sure exactly what rights the preferred stock class has, but the founders have had control through common stock for as long as I can remember.

Now, [ARKW]( has 2,575,137 shares of WORK remaining.

However, according to 3 major media outlets -- Forbes, CNBC, and Business Insider -- today, Salesforce is expected to price Slack at a premium above its current market cap.

(I would very much like to link the articles, but this subreddit bans Forbes and possibly CNBC for reasons that I do not understand. In any case, this is the same information that 3 major media outlet reported today. If you have a better source, please post it!)

Why would ARKW sell 36% of its position in WORK a day before the acquisition announcement, when Salesforce is expected to pay more for the shares than the current market price?

* **Safe**: The market is likely to be fairly stable without huge downsides.

* **Room to grow**: Either in it's core market or it is entering into **growing** new markets where the company is likely to win.

My favorite picks are:

* Walmart: One of the strongest lower-end consumer goods retailer. Will do well in a recession. Room to grow from its online division. With good logistics could take some market share from Amazon.

* Unity Software: Enjoys a duopoly in video game engines. Video and mobile games are a growing market that's not slowing down anytime soon. Adoption of 5G and VR gives Unity new markets for growth.

* TSMC: Makes 50% of the world's chips. 5G, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing will only drive up demand.

0,k4n6x8,Platinum as an investment," Everybody talks about gold, and of course crypto these days, but other investment metals also have some utility, especially the cheaper ones. Some points of the article are:

\- Historically there is a premium for Platinum since it is a more rare metal

\- It has real industrial usage, mainly in auto-cats in cars and trucks. But also has use in jewelry.

\- Palladium was a cheaper replacement for platinum in cars but it is currently more than twice the price of platinum. Pall's only use is in auto-cats. Theoretically the trend should revert back to platinum.

\- Hydrogen fuel cells use platinum. This is a concept being talked about as a progression of EV cars.

Some negative points is that platinum jewelry isn't as popular anymore. Actually jewelry in general. It doesn't seem like a millennial thing to me.

0,k44tfp,$DMYD : Own the Big Data Provider that Powers DraftKings and Fanduel WSB Crosspost," 

[UK's Genius Sports bets on NY-listed SPAC to go public in $1.5 billion deal](

[](

[Investor Presentation](

**TL;DR at bottom**

We've seen a huge shift in momentum for SPACs lately with pretty much every SPAC from fraudulent to zero revenue mooning to a pretty high entry point. Do you know what genuine company has been under the radar and stayed relatively unknown? Genius Sports.

Genius Sports (Ticker: DMYD) basically captures and provides sports stats, data and technology that powers sports betting platforms, such as DraftKings, Fanduel, etc. on behalf of professional leagues

* Some things to note:  

   * With the advent of in-sports real-time betting, the market is exploding at over **25%** annually
   * More states are legalizing sports betting, serving as a major growth catalyst: Genius customers are seeing **2-3x revenue growth** in 2020
   * Sports leagues are coming back in fully in 2021 with COVID vaccination just on the horizon
   * This is a **duopoly market with high barriers of entry**, the other main rival being Sportsradar (remember the FEAC hype?)
* Genius has a clear **economic moat** built around:  

   * Proprietary technology to track and record in-game statistics on behalf of major sports leagues, in exchange for data rights
   * **7,000+ statisticians and agents** on the ground, **managing 240K+ events per year**
   * Highly customizable software that manages every aspect of a sportsbook’s data and trading offering, including advertising and streaming services
   * Significant opportunity for inorganic growth via M&amp;A
   * Highly fragmented market for technology, content and media within sports ripe for consolidation to boost growth outside of plan

Partnerships

Their technology has proved to be incredibly well made with long term contracts with some big dogs you'll recognize:

Basketball: NBA, NCAA, March Madness

Soccer: FIFA, Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga

Golf: PGA, LPGA, European Tour

Racing: NASCAR

Online Sportsbooks: DraftKings &amp; Fanduel

Traditional Sportsbooks: MGM, Caesars, SkyBet, William Hill

Financials

* Already makes **$140M+** in revenue AND is **profitable**, with **$14M in 2020 EBITDA**
* Growing at **30% CAGR**, with $230M revenue and $68M EBITDA by 2022
* **$500M+** **EBITDA** **potential** in the horizon
* Customer contracts have **guaranteed minimums** with upside on usage. The majority of 2020 revenue is **locked in** **for 3-4 years** on average
* Only ever lost one customer in the past three years

Trading dynamics

* Deal was overlooked because it was announced just before the election (10/27/20), one of the worst trading weeks for the entire market
* Reddit following has been limited and Stocktwits nonexistent
* Average volume of 259.78K with a LOI signed.

If Genius Sports were to trade at similar 2022E revenue multiple of 19x as Draftkings, it would imply a stock price of **$24-25**

0,k45cfl,I want to be wrong: The Golden Age of Investing seems to be over,"Disclaimer: I am a pessimist by nature.

Hey.

So I have a problem. I made easy gains on stocks this past year, without knowing how to pick stocks or do proper due diligence, without picking meme stocks.

I basically threw darts at the S&amp;P 500 board, after highlighting certain sectors I felt were going to bounce back. And I made what I perceive to be a shitload of money.

My thinking is this: if the stock market is the only game left in town, I want to find other games. Because if people are thinking that this is the only game, the game is getting riskier and riskier (i.e. more expensive and more unlikely to produce future gains).

In the past, investors had options for their money. They could invest in bonds that yielded relatively healthy, risk free returns. Real estate was much cheaper. Education (invest in yourself) was cheaper. 

I believe the options enabled healthier valuations for each class of asset. Now... bonds seem expensive. Real estate seems expensive. Gold seems expensive. Bitcoin seems expensive. Education... really super fucking expensive. And stocks?

Stocks look like they have priced in 10 years' worth of intrinsic economic growth.

My question is this... what do we do to secure our futures? If previous generations had access to healthy markets with opportunities for growth, what does the current generation have? Where do we look? Foreign markets? 

What are you guys doing, broadly, to invest in your futures? Are there any other investing 'games' we can play? Bonds, stocks, gold, real estate, formal education all seem to be overpriced. Should we use the easy money policies to start up our own businesses?

0,k4n6dt,Question about investing in small-/mid- caps,"  Serious question from a relatively new investor – sorry if it is redundant.

I am looking to start investing and I sense that ETFs are better suited for my anxious constitution. Reading online, I came to understand that ETFs that track the S&amp;P 500 (eg. SPY or VOO) are regularly recommended to new investors. However, looking at the historical trend, I see that both IJR and IJK (Blackrock’s small and mid-cap ETF) have outperformed SPY. Hence, my question, why aren’t small and mid-cap index ETFs more popular?

Many thanks!

^ Peak 5 Year Price = $1142/Stock

**$GUSH = $34 | $324-835 | $1462**

*Not peak price but 1 year highs*

Assume $10,000 invested

GUSH = x42 (4200%) = $420,000

ERX = x12.22 (1220%) = $122,200








**Key Points:**

* Price is dependent on $XOP and $XLE since they are tracked by these companies. I am focusing on the oil aspect (not raw crude prices) and supply chains. 

* Mixture of Energy ETFs (leveraged). Energy does include oil, I am focusing on oil. 

*  Highest yield growth in terms of recovery stocks/ETFs 

* If you really think oil exploration is going to end during EV, you’re very wrong. Boomers are just waiting for a recovery and have doubled up on it. 

* One of the underlying stocks is Chevron (NYSE: CVX) Chevron is engaged in every aspect of the oil, natural gas, including hydrocarbon exploration and production; refining, marketing and transport; chemicals manufacturing and sales; and power generation

* This includes the aspect of Fractional Distillation which has reduced in demand than normal during covid due to exportation issues. 

* To go deeper, fractional distillation is used for: Bitumen for roads and roofing. | Fuels for ships, factories and central heating. | Lubricating oils, waxes, and polishes. | Diesel fuels (many of the trains around the world still use this). | Jet fuel, paraffin for lighting and heating. (Airlines are starting to pick up in demand and many have started taking in bookings to prepare for flights &amp;amp;gt; more consumption of jet fuels). | Petrol for vehicles (reduction in demand for this due to EVs and hybrids but this is the only aspect). | Chemicals. | Liquefied petroleum gas. 

* Biden supports renewable energy, but he would make sure the old money gets their run, as old money still runs the economy. - Leading to recovery. 

* Roads are still using to use refined crude oil despite the EV market. 

* These companies within these EFTs have invested heavily into solar energy, supporting sustainability, and adapting to changing markets. Which Biden is known for. 

* In terms of Leveraged EFT/Stocks = UCO (leveraged crude oil) used to be the reliable one but they changed their method to investment method because they couldn’t survive March 2020, so these are the best alternatives.  

* All companies within the EFT are reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

* It’s 3x leverage, what do you expect, high risk high reward. 

* Recovery Stock


**Risk:**

* Leveraged Stocks and ETFs are high risk high reward plays but cannot liquidate such as a leveraged/options contracts

* Gives common stock buyers and holders a high risk opportunity play. 

* TQQQ recovered higher than it did recover and that’s leveraged Nasdaq, this is due to percentage growth

* Leveraged Stocks and ETFs are high risk high reward plays this will include drawdowns. (Highly volatile). 

* High overhead costs but this gets isn’t a issue due to high cash flow of these companies. 

* If you buy leveraged contracts or options you’ll have deeper profits but hope you have enough collateral to survive the drawdowns. 

* This is high risk and won’t give you overnight returns but will give a decent gain only IF it works out.

0,k4b0g7,"De facto dollar cost averaging; or, how to sweat the small stuff.","I have heard a lot of debate over $-cost averaging (DCA) vs lump sum investing (LSI). There seems to be conflicting evidence about which is better for returns (I read on Reddit or bogleheads that LSI outperformed 68% of the time over some 10-yr windows, but I’m sure someone can dig up counter-evidence); &amp; that DCA can be better from a psychological perspective b/c you’re buying dips etc. 

I have always invested haphazardly into my personal after-tax (IRA, 529) accounts — i.e. when I felt we had enough $ built up, I would dump it in. Now that my wife &amp; I are older, wiser, vastly wealthier (I.e. we can max our retirement accounts), &amp; she of course is more beautiful, I decided to finally “grow up” &amp; do disciplined DCA. 

But as I was evenly dividing out the investment amounts on a weekly/biweekly/monthly basis &amp; trying to figure out what interval is best, 2 thoughts hit me. These made me realize that DCA is, for most long-term investors, kind of a wash:

1) Most / many salaried employees will end up DCAing by virtue of an organization-sponsored retirement account (e.g. 401k, 403b, HSA) — you set the contribution rate &amp; there’s a regular paycheck deduction. I would imagine that for many, this is a major source of investing, &amp; is at least some measure of DCA.

2) DCA / LSI requires a timespan over which to compare. For most investors we’re talking about a few decades. That means that even if one were to dump in all available money once each year, you’d still be effectively DCAing year over year.

My conclusion basically was: keep doing what we’re doing, just with more money.

At first I thought gold however the minimum amount to invest is quite large.

Because of this I started looking at silver, since a maple leaf coin costs only like 23 euros. In the past year there was one occasion when the rates were very low (400 euros per kg), and in the past five years such a low has happened about 3 times. Right now the rates are 610 euros per kg and in recent years the rates have never been above 800 euros. I think the best choice is to wait for another low. Do you agree with this?

Just posting this since I can’t go back in time to tell myself, but maybe my experiences will help out some other noobs who only have time to trade as a side-hustle. I really have no idea of what I’m doing, so take this post with a grain of salt... However, if you see something wrong with my strategy, feel free to tear it apart! 

I’ve traded off and on since May with okay results—40% gains overall. However, my account dipped below $25k this morning so I couldn’t sell my FOMO shares without being marked as a pattern day trader, so I’ve just been watching my account go down further and further...and then start to go back up... I was down about $1000 and as of now I’m back in the green +$400 or so... 

A blessing in disguise? Maybe. Given that I couldn’t sell when I wanted to, I was forced to hold and I’m glad I did. This led me to evaluate some of the stocks I bought back in July that made a decent profit, dipped triggering me to panic sell after losing most of the gains, only to buy back in later at a higher price. Interestingly, if I would have held these stocks through the dips, my profits would have been well over the measly 40%—im talking 300% or more. 

For example, if I would have held onto the 4 TSLA shares I bought for $995 (pre-split), I’d have 20 shares now worth about 4x what I paid. Similar story with PLUG, BLNK, LAC, APHA and FCEL. My initial investment of $25k*would be worth over $100k had I forgot I invested, and it would have saved countless hours of stress and anxiety. *note: it’s under $25k now because I’ve been using profits to remodel my house. 

That said, I’m going to try this hold and see approach starting tomorrow. Tomorrow I’ll clear out my FOMO stocks and maintain a dozen or so promising positions that I believe are set to boom over the next year or so—primarily anything having to do with EV, renewable energy and marijuana. Limiting myself to just ~$2k initial investments in each stock should limit the risk (unless everything tanks long term, which I think is unlikely). I’ll then try to only check my account every two weeks. Not as sexy as day trading, but it might make sense for folks like me who work fulltime. 

So far I’m thinking:
[TSLA, duh]
[LAC, up and coming lithium mine near Tesla’s NV battery factory]
[PLUG, charging stations]
[BLNK, charging stations]
[FCEL, alternative energy]
[HEXO, marijuana]
[APHA, marijuana]
[NOVA, solar]
[RUN, solar]
[And a variety of ARK_ ETFs. ]

Any thoughts?? Am I missing anything? Any of these seem like a bad bet?

Today HCAC IS dropping so badly. Do any of you know, why?
This company looks so interesting, the founders and the team are very well-known in the automotive industry and as far as I search do not find the reason why investors sell their positions so badly. 
The stock is already down by 7% at this time.
I think this company has a lot of potential for car making industry, since they use their car as a modular system. Most of the parts are seperated (skateboard technique), steering by wire, etc.
I do know that the final product is coming in 2022 but as far as I see their knowledge, idea, and business model is thoughtful and meaningful.

0,k3e4rs,Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox," December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

 They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts]( Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm’s S-1 filing](

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers]( Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon]( and [Walmart](, have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back]( Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%  
Net loss: $149 million

[DoorDash S-1 filing](

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth]( in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating]( in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games]( Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple]( or [Google]( software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

## Wish (ContextLogic)

Symbol: WISH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  
Revenue growth: 32%  
Gross margin: 65%  
Net loss: $176 million

[Wish S-1 filing](

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](, and [eBay](, Wish [focuses its e-commerce services]( on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish’s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.

**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish’s business with new rules or requirements.

0,k3tokt,LGVW // Butterfly Network – Room for a Bullish Case,"Ok gents, little has been written about the LGVW-Butterfly deal. Between nurses/docs super excited about the product and the usual hype, I thought to **write a sound DD based on available facts** as I did for [Microvast]( and [AvePoint]( You may be sick of hearing about SPACs in 2020, but do keep an open mind about em bc solid companies are entering the mkt as well. Let’s dive in

**30 secs elevator pitch**: on November 19, 2020, Longview (LGVW) entered into a definitive business combination agreement with Butterfly Network (thereafter “The Company”), valuing the latter at an Enterprise Value of $1.5Bn, after a Letter of Intent signed in Oct20. The proposed business combination is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021, with the combined company’s Class A common stock trading on the NYSE under the ticker BFLY. The Company makes ultrasound proprietary technology more universally accessible and affordable and it’s backed by The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation

**Investment Case Intro**: Butterfly attacks a large, $8 billion addressable market and expands it materially by meaningfully growing each of the following: points of care, geographic reach and use cases. Moreover, Butterfly has many attractive investment attributes: strong balance sheet and liquidity, low manufacturing costs, rapid growth, high recurring revenue, a discounted relative valuation and high-return reinvestment ops

**// What is Butterfly Network and why should I care?**

Butterfly Network is an innovative digital health company that is working to enable universal access to superior medical imaging. Key takeaway:

* **In short**: founded by Dr. Jonathan Rothberg (winner of Presidential Medal of Tech &amp; Innovation) in 2011 and led by CEO Laurent Faracci, Butterfly has created the world’s first handheld, single-probe whole-body ultrasound system, Butterfly iQ, to make ultrasound technology more universally accessible and affordable
* **Addressing an unmet need**: Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) represents the biggest paradigm shift since x-ray. Historically, the global ultrasound market has been dominated by traditional cart-based devices that are accessible only to highly specialized technicians and are located predominantly in hospitals, imaging centres, and physicians’ offices. POCUS usage today has been constrained by high upfront system cost, limited access, and suboptimal convenience. Notably 2/3 of the world has no access to medical imaging and 2/3 of diagnostic dilemmas can be addressed through simple imaging. The addressable market is represented by $6Bn of equipment market and $2Bn of service market, with an addressable population of 40M+ Global Healthcare Practitioners. Ultrasound uses sound waves instead of radiation and it’s pushed by several macrotrends: (i) aging population, (ii) chronic disease proliferation, (iii) move from hospital to home settings and (iv) wellness monitoring
* **What about R&amp;D?** While smartphone-based ultrasound devices have existed for years, Butterfly is the first to completely re-engineer the technology behind acquiring images. The goal? Increase quality and efficiency while decreasing costs. To accomplish this, Butterfly engineers had to figure out how to replace the very core element of the ultrasound probe – the piezoelectric crystals. Using sophisticated physics and fancy math, these piezoelectric crystals are used to ‘transduce’ sound energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Butterfly’s new smartphone-based ultrasound device replaces expensive transducer crystals with computer chip technology, resulting in a device that costs less than $2,000, while currently emergency departments spend $25,000 to $250,000 to purchase and maintain sophisticated and cumbersome ‘portable’ ultrasound machines
* **Relative analysis**: there are arguably three other major competitors to Butterfly iQ in the handheld ultrasound market: GE Vscan Extend, Philips Lumify, and the Clarius Wireless Scanner. Each of these devices are FDA approved for most of the major uses of POC (Point- of-Care) ultrasound. No other device on the market has a 3-in-1 transducer, which leads to doubling and tripling of cost for each additional probe. Additionally, only the Philips Lumify and Clarius are smartphone based. From a cost perspective, there is no comparison. Butterfly iQ drastically reduces the upfront cost, and there is no extra charge for their cloud computing and storage. Not to mention, the iQ is the only probe pushing the limits of AI and deep learning. In case you like CNBC, they listed Butterfly as one of the 50 [2020 disruptors companies](

*Comment of a Reseller, take it or leave it: “I literally sell ultrasound for living. Butterfly is going to have a subscription service and this is seriously in high demand. 25% of my leads are currently asking for this tech. My starting price of Phillips is between 4.5-5k, Chinese brands start at 2500”*

* **Expected &amp; Current Financials**: Butterfly has Substantial Growth Potential Across Multiple End-Markets with 65% revenue CAGR from 2019-2024E. Currently the company holds $500 million of cash to drive it through its investment phase and to expected positive cash flow. Significant discount to comparables, with 10.6x 2022E revenues with 70+% growth versus comparables at 13-20x+ 2022E revenues, with meaningfully slower growth. Total investment of over $400 million with first product introduced in 2018, 700+ patents and 2020E revenue of $44 million, projected to grow to $138 million in 2022E
* **Who’s managing my money?** Founder Dr. Jonathan Rothberg to become Chairman of the combined company and will be Butterfly’s largest controlling shareholder. 100% of the equity of existing Butterfly Network investors, including Baillie Gifford, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Fosun Industrial Co., Limited, will convert into shares of the combined company. There will be no selling stockholders in the transaction

**// Ok so what am I buying here? LGVW**

* Longview Acquisition Corp. is a Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation brought public as an affiliate of Glenview Capital Management. Glenview was founded in 2000 by Larry Robbins and is currently in its 20th year of active public markets investing with a focus on the healthcare market. Initially capitalized with $414 million in cash in May 2020 trading under the ticker LGVW
* The transaction is expected to deliver up to $589 million of gross proceeds, including up to $414 million of cash held in Longview’s trust account (assuming no redemptions are effected). The transaction is further supported by a $175 million PIPE at $10.00 per share, led by Eldridge, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, Glenview, Ridgeback, Tenet Healthcare Corporation, UPMC Enterprises, the innovation, commercialization and venture capital arm of leading Pittsburgh-based health system UPMC, and Wellington Management. The company is projected to have approximately $584 million in cash on the balance sheet after closing

&gt;31 senior executives from Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche were involved in  ‘Mission T’, as it was dubbed. The event revolved around how we can  catch up with Tesla – a company focused exclusively on the future,  without a traditional car business. Its Silicon Valley-style ecosystem  is influenced by software capabilities, focus on technology and risk culture.

Now think about it. Why would Volkswagen, a company that sells 11 million vehicles annually give a shit about a small ""startup"" that sells 500k vehicles a year? - They are scared shitless.

&gt;The global transformation in the industry will take roughly ten years,  with or without Volkswagen. To mitigate climate change, we must  electrify our powertrains. Advances in artificial intelligence,  especially in situational perception, will soon replace drivers with a  learning global neural network. 

Yup.

&gt; VW has to change utterly:  to a digital company that reliably operates millions of mobility devices  worldwide, communicates constantly with customers and improves services, comfort and safety weekly or, ideally, daily.  

Exactly what TSLA is doing with over the air updates.

&gt; One thing we lacked when I took up my position at Volkswagen five years  ago, and which is still in short supply, is time. Even then, Volkswagen  was already late-to-market with electrification and digitalization in  particular.  

Late like every other car manufacturer.

&gt; build the technology, especially digital technology, we need for the  Group as a whole. This will turn our cars into digital devices 

Cars will become another platform to sell software. Exactly what TSLA is doing.

&gt; The future of the automobile is exciting and fascinating – in around ten years, we will have self-driving cars.  That is an immense new segment, and will create a host of new opportunities. 

What car manufacturer do you think has the best Self driving software?

&gt; In ten years, the most valuable company in the world will be a mobility company again.

0,k43pj0,Poke holes in my theory....mREITs beats SP500 over the long run,"I am one of many who think large cap and equities in general wont have the run over the next 10 years that they did over the past 10 years. I have always been fond of mortgage REITs and would like another set of eyes on this process. **See picture link below.** 

SPY as you know is the largest ETF that tracks the SP500. NLY is the largest mortgage REIT by market cap with the majority of their revenue coming from Fannie/Freddie backed loans. Here is the situation:

In 1997, you invest $10k into SPY and $10k into NLY and reinvest the NLY dividends over 22 years, the ending value of **SPY is $46,823** and ending value in **NLY is $93,477** before any taxes. I used 11/25/2019 as the ending date to avoid data skew from the recent draw down of REITs.

In terms of tax liability, you are obviously paying uncle sam on those quarterly dividends for NLY, but your ending capital gain is *much* smaller than what it is in SPY over your original basis due to the growth nature.

Why am i wrong?

0,k3i29v,Wall Street Braces As Tesla Addition to S&amp;P 500 Could Put $100 Billion Into Play," 

Wall Street is bracing for Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) arrival to the S&amp;P 500 Index on Dec. 18.

What Happened: The addition of the California-based automaker is expected to create challenges because of the company's size, $555 billion, and volatility. Tesla's share price jumped 40% right after the S&amp;P 500 announcement on Nov. 16, and the addition comes at a time of pandemic-related volatility, the Wall Street Journal reports. 

Tesla is the biggest company to ever join the index, and it’ll be the sixth largest by market capitalization. 

Elon Musk’s company might put $100 billion “in motion” when added, as funds try to sell other companies’ stock to buy Tesla’s, according to WSJ.

To help ease the potential trading chaos, some Wall Street managers recommend splitting the addition “over two trading days,” something that has never happened before, WSJ notes.

Ben Inker, who manages asset allocation at investment manager GMO believes any unpreparedness might have consequences. “The people who will pay the price if S&amp;P screws up are the investors in passive S&amp;P,” he says.

Why It Matters: Tesla's addition to the S&amp;P 500 also happens the same day the so-called “quadruple witching” takes place. Every last Friday of the quarter marks the day when futures and options expire at the same time, which increases the volume.

This, investors say, might help with the liquidity that day but may also increase market volatility.  ",15,220,wall street brace tesla addition amp p could put billion play,wall street bracing tesla inc nasdaq tsla arrival amp p index dec happened addition california based automaker expected create challenge company size billion volatility tesla share price jumped right amp p announcement nov addition come time pandemic related volatility wall street journal report tesla biggest company ever join index sixth largest market capitalization elon musk company might put billion motion added fund try sell company stock buy tesla according wsj help ease potential trading chaos wall street manager recommend splitting addition two trading day something never happened wsj note ben inker manages asset allocation manager gmo belief unpreparedness might consequence people pay price amp p screw investor passive amp p say matter tesla addition amp p also happens day called quadruple witching take place every last friday quarter mark day future option expire time increase volume investor say might help liquidity day may also increase market volatility
0,k3xctf,Palantir Adds $17 Billion in Value in Best Week Since Debut,"Palantir Technologies Inc. posted its best week since it went public in September, adding about $17 billion in market value as a broad rally in tech stocks helped fuel gains in the software maker.

Its shares rose 52% since Monday and touched a fresh intraday record at $33.50. The stock lost some of the gains on Friday after Citron Research said in a tweet it was shorting the stock with a $20 target. The company ended the session at $27.66.

Palantir representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“A lot of institutions have probably warmed up to the company and are viewing it as something to hold onto for the long term,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “It’s a great software company, and it has a terrific business, a very sticky business, not just with governments but also enterprises.”

Trading in Palantir options also surged this week with average daily volume of call contracts jumping about 250% in the first three days of the week when compared to the prior week. An analysis of open interest shows most of the contracts being opened and closed in the same day, indicating a heavy presence of day traders.

After an initial lackluster performance following its direct-listing stock debut, gains for the Denver-based firm, which sells data-analysis tools, have accelerated after hedge funds, including Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, reported purchasing the company’s shares.

“Big-data companies have become very important and historically have been excellent stocks. Also, Palantir is benefiting from the pandemic -- tracking cases and analyzing data is right in its wheelhouse,” Kaufman said.

Since starting up in 2003, co-founder and chairman Peter Thiel has helped bankroll the business throughout its long period as a closely held business. Now, the stock has gained nearly 300% since its direct listing. It reported third-quarter losses in its first financial results since going public as compensation costs surged. It did, however, boost its revenue growth forecast for the year to 44%, exceeding the amount analysts expected on average.

“I’d say the days of it trading below $20 are probably over,” Kaufman added.

0,k3fw3z,Lemonade (LMND) up 50% since last month. Why I plan on holding for the long term.,"Disclaimer: 20% (12k) of my portfolio is now in lemonade and I plan on holding for the long term, so I’m extremely biased.

Dave Lee recently released an interview of the CEO Daniel Schreiber on his channel a couple of weeks ago. He is currently doing a series investigating the company and has managed to catch SQ and PTON at 1/6, 1/4 their current price and was a super early investor of Tesla. 

During the interview they've touched on subjects such as Lemonade's advantage vs Incumbents. How Lemonade isn't reliant on a lot of legacy systems that larger insurance companies rely on such as off the shelf software some of which are still written in COBOL, broker based systems, etc… How it's harder for larger, less lean, insurance companies to just reinvent themselves and replicate Lemonade's software over night.

They've also talked about their expansion plans. Lemonade can expand anywhere geographically without having a physical presence there and they plan on releasing a new insurance product every 6-8 months with auto-insurance being a strong candidate after they've released life insurance.

They've talked about the lifetime value of their customers. Their initial strategy was to market towards millennials and first time insurance purchasers, which they’ve succeeded in. Every time a customer graduates from renters to home insurance, the profits generated by that customer increases by 6x with no additional cost to the company. Their profit margins doubled from 20% in Q3 2019 to 40% in q4 2020.

One important point that Schreiber made is that the total addressable market of insurance is at 4 trillion, and lemonade's market cap is still only at \~4 billion as of this writing. About 1/10 the size of a lot of large insurance companies. So they don’t need to outcompete, just do reasonably well in order for this to be a good investment.

0,k3sda4,Odeon Capital says retail REITs' rebound is 'just beginning',"

&gt; Climbing collection rates bode well for retail-focused REITs, as the owners of open-air shopping centers, enclosed malls, and other retail assets claw their way back from May's trough, writes Odeon Capital analyst Alex Arnold.

&gt; And investors have noticed. Retail REIT shares, on the whole, have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the past month as seen in the gains made by the S&amp;P Composite 1500 Retail REITs Index:

&gt; ""While the reversion is just beginning, we'd expect surging infection rates in the coming months to drive increased group volatility and entry points along the way,"" Arnold said in a  note to clients.

&gt; ""Q3 collections were not only up in aggregate but also across all shopping center types,"" he added. ""October is looking even better.""
Arnold classifieds the retail REITs into three buckets: Net lease REITs, where tenants take care of their own properties; Community centers described as open-air and frequently grocery-anchored; and Enclosed mall players.
During the pandemic, net lease players, though still down over the past year, fared the best, followed by community centers then enclosed mall REITs.",9,177,odeon capital say retail reit rebound beginning,gt climbing collection rate bode well retail focused reit owner open air shopping center enclosed mall retail asset claw way back may trough writes odeon capital analyst alex arnold gt investor noticed retail reit share whole outperformed amp p past month seen gain made amp p composite retail reit index gt reversion beginning expect surging infection rate coming month drive increased group volatility entry point along way arnold said note client gt q collection aggregate also across shopping center type added october looking even better arnold classified retail reit three bucket net lease reit tenant take care property community center described open air frequently grocery anchored enclosed mall player pandemic net lease player though still past year fared best followed community center enclosed mall reit
0,k4adtj,10 golden tips for investing newbies,"Reading through some of the posts I can see how a lot of newbies have FOMO (fear of missing out). Post after post of losers making huge returns. Everyone is getting rich but you. Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor realizes it’s all hype. Some of it works, most of it doesn’t. To be successful you need to be able to recognize the difference and to do that, you need time, knowledge, and practice.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are ten tips that can help you along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 1 - You don’t know shit

&amp;#x200B;

You’re going to lose your money. Don’t get suckered by reading posts about guys who made 1000% return in 5 minutes. For every one guy that posts his massive gains, 100+ suckers have lost their money. The first lesson to realize is that it’s way easier to lose money in the market than to make money.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 2 - Understand how money flows in the market

&amp;#x200B;

Money moves from the idiots to the knowledgable, from the impatient to the patient. Any dummy can make money short term. But to make money long-term and truly grow a portfolio, you have to be armed with knowledge and a shit ton of patience.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 3 - Play for the long term

&amp;#x200B;

The most important rule you need to follow religiously is NEVER FUCKING LOSE MONEY. Print it big, tape it to your wall. Your top responsibility is protecting your capital. YOLO is a stupid play. 99% of you are going to bet at the wrong time with the wrong stock. Calm the fuck down and work on a long term strategy. You have decades dummy.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 4 - Time is on your side, but not much else

&amp;#x200B;

The market never stops. The machine just churns and churns. Rich to poor, poor to rich, it just keeps on turning and turning. There are ALWAYS opportunities. Another IPO. Another MEME turd. FOMO is for fools. Miss a run? Big fucking deal. There’s another one around the corner. You have plenty of time to learn, test, and grow your capital.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 5 - Paper Trading

&amp;#x200B;

Paper trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with real active data but it’s all practice. No real money exchanges. It’s a great way to learn, to see how shitty you’re going to do without losing a penny. DO THIS FOR TWO YEARS. Take whatever capital you have right now and buy some long term ETFs or solid ass stocks with minimal risk. Keep adding to it EVERY paycheck. Build up some capital for when you’re ready to trade for real. Take two years to learn how to trade, watch your paper portfolio go to zero a couple dozen times, read and follow the news, WSB, Stocktwits, etc. Ask questions, test out your strategies. You’ll thank me two years from now.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 6 - Understand taxes

&amp;#x200B;

Big difference between short term and long term capital gains. Uncle Sam loves you short-timers. Paying taxes is for suckers.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 7 - No one knows shit

&amp;#x200B;

There is no crystal ball, no one has the “inside track”, and only believe 10% of what you read. Be very fucking skeptical. About everything. Social media, analysts, CEOs, news, all of it, be fucking skeptical. It’s all manipulation. Don’t even trust Buffett. You are the guardian of your capital. Everyone wants to take it away from you. Understand that and you won’t get suckered so easily.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations

&amp;#x200B;

As much as the market today feels like a casino, the underlying foundation of the market is investing, not gambling. With every stock, you buy you’re buying a piece of a business. Learn to read fundamentals. Do they make money? Are they growing? Do they have debt? How are their competitors valued? Do they make more money today than they did 5 years ago? How will they make more? How do they return capital to shareholders? And on and on and on. Learn motherfuckers. Earnings per share. P/E rations. Intrinsic value. Net income. Figure out formulas for valuing stocks. Is TSLA worth over 250x earnings? Is WFC undervalued at 13x earnings? Investing blindly because big\_dick\_loser said so in a post is beyond idiotic. Just burn your money, you’ll have more fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for suckers

&amp;#x200B;

Remove the bookmark for Ferrari. You ain’t getting one anytime soon. Play fucking smart. Go long. Think in decades, not days. You’re not smart enough to day trade and beat the system. Not long-term anyways. Most of you won’t beat the market over 10 years. So be fucking smart. Paper trade until you can consistently prove gains month after month. When you’re ready to trade for real, dip in slowly. Fuck FOMO. Fuck YOLO. Remember, time is on your side. Compound that shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication

&amp;#x200B;

Like anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it. Easy money never lasts. Dig in, learn, practice, rinse, and repeat. Be motivated to learn how to invest, take the time to study, read, test, and constantly improve. Be disciplined with your money. It’s fucking hard to make, easy to lose. Protect that shit.

&amp;#x200B;

\--

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you, this resonates with, you’ll be fine long term. Do the fucking work. For those of you who love chasing the fantasy, good luck, I mean it. It’s a tough fucking pill to swallow watching your account get dwindled down to zero. Nothing tastes worse than losing all your money.

General Motors Co. GM -0.88% will supply fuel cells to Nikola Corp. NKLA -7.64% for commercial trucks but will no longer take an equity stake in the startup under a stripped-down agreement, Nikola said Monday.


The electric-truck company also said it has scrapped plans to build a pickup truck named the Badger, which had been part of an earlier deal with GM outlined in September. That deal got delayed after a negative short seller’s report raised questions about the readiness of some aspects of Nikola’s business, allegations the company claimed were false and misleading.

Nikola shares were down 3.4% in premarket trading Monday. GM shares were off about 0.8%.

Under their original deal, GM was to take an 11% equity stake in the Phoenix-based startup in exchange for supplying engineering work and other services. GM also was to engineer and build an electric pickup truck for retail customers, the Badger, using the auto maker’s proprietary technology for battery-powered vehicles.

0,k3je76,"Airbnb, Doordash Aim for Higher-Than-Expected Valuations Ahead of Debuts","Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.  are planning to release higher-than-expected valuation ranges for their initial public offerings, in the latest sign of strength in a booming market for new issues.

 Airbnb  is planning to target a range of around  $30 billion to $33 billion  - - using a fully diluted share count -- when the home-rental startup kicks off its investor roadshow Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter. That is greater than  $30 billion  people close to the offering had expected.

 DoorDash , meanwhile, plans to target a range of around  $25 billion to $28 billion  on a fully diluted basis ahead of a roadshow expected to begin Monday. That is greater than the  $25 billion  people close to the offering had expected.

Typically companies and their underwriters seek to set relatively conservative initial ranges, with room to potentially price the shares at the high end or above them before trading starts.

It's not clear what per-share price ranges the companies will disclose.

 Airbnb  and  DoorDash  are on track for listings in mid-December -- typically a quiet month for offerings, ending a banner year for IPOs with a bang. There has already been a record amount of money raised in new issues on U.S. exchanges as soaring technology valuations entice a raft of private companies to join the public markets.

Activity has been buoyed by the record-setting run for the stock market. The Nasdaq Composite hit a new closing record on Friday during a holiday- shortened trading session. The  S&amp;P  500 is a near record too, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average vaulted above the 30000 mark for the first time last week.

So far this year, more than  $140 billion  has been raised in 383 initial public offerings on U.S. exchanges, far exceeding the previous full-year record high set at the height of the dot-com boom in 1999, according to Dealogic data that dates back to 1995.

Both  Airbnb  and  DoorDash  have weathered the coronavirus pandemic as more people shun hotels in favor of houses for vacations or longer-term stays, and order out to avoid restaurants.

 Airbnb  was valued at  $31 billion  in a 2017 investment round. The  San Francisco  company's valuation fell to  $18 billion  when bookings plummeted at the outset of the pandemic as travel came to a virtual standstill.

 Airbnb  Chief Executive  Brian Chesky  quickly borrowed  $2 billion , slashed marketing spending, laid off a quarter of the company's staff and put many noncore projects on hold. Bookings at  Airbnb  rebounded by summer, though nowhere near pre-pandemic levels, as people increasingly seek houses for local getaways.

For  DoorDash , a valuation of more than  $25 billion  would continue what has been a sharp upward march.  San Francisco -based  DoorDash's  private valuation had already ballooned to more than  $15 billion  this year from just  $1.4 billion  in 2018 as it took an even greater share of the U.S. food-delivery market. It is now the biggest player in the sector.

For both companies, their roadshows will look different than they would have in the pre-Covid world. Executives at both companies will market their offerings to mutual funds and hedge funds in Zoom meetings rather than in a whirlwind tour across the country.

Both companies and their respective underwriters will set their final IPO prices based on feedback from investors in the roadshows.

3) VWO holds significantly more holdings, pretty much all tail-ends, including a lot of China Class A shares.

4) There is only 74% overlap (by weight) between them (per etfrc), presumably due to the lack of South Korea and its absence being re-deployed differently.

I've been reading about South Korea's demographic problems (admittedly China has its own demographic problems anticipated), and from a lay point of view they 'act' like a Developed economy, so I am not sure which direction to go in for a long hold.

0,k3m9aa,(X) Risk Premium? But what are at Risk?,"In the hope to capture as much the risk premium out there (because I’m greedy), I, as a long-term index investor did a bit of research to gather information about these premiums and it left me confused in this specific aspect. 

It is my understanding that:

“The market is rewarding me, the investor, an (x) risk premium in term of higher long-term expected return because I took more risk”

But if said index’s long term expected return are higher(example: VBR&gt;SPY), then what risk are at stake for my part that I deserve the premium? As an example, I completely understand that TQQQ are providing me more “premium” in exchange for the “risk” that the entire TQQQ can go to zero and never recovers. That make sense. 

However, I don’t see that my money are in a big chunk of risk to permanently lose value if I were to say take on the value premium or equity premium in a decent span of time of 20-30 years. So the “risk” everyone is referring to merely higher volatility? And that it would trailed the market for long periods of time. If it were the case then these are no risk at all since one could easily be negated by simply waiting for the premium to kick in, right?

I own a (relatively, for me) large chunk of RKT shares. Over the past month, this share has fallen flat and has seen relatively little price action. However, since this stock has IPO'd in august, institutional ownership has risen to 86% of the float. While this has the delay of 45-90 business days that 13-F filings allow, I have no sign that these institutions have sold so far. 

My question is the following: with only a couple of million shares remaining for retailers, what does this mean for price action? Obviously ""smart money"" is confident for the years to come and the shares are becoming increasingly scarce meaning supply and demand will drive the price up, but without the volume and retail buyers driving the price up will this happen?

0,k2rs84,// THCB &amp; Microvast Inc - Legit Analysis,"The EV craze is seeing another ops, the reverse merger of Microvast. **On Nov 13 a letter of intent (LoI) has been signed related to a business combination with Microvast Inc.**, a market leading provider of next-generation **battery technologies for commercial and specialty use electric vehicles**

This name already came up on WSB gents, so the below it’s more of an in-depth DD before the next bell. Good to credit other DD as well for a sort of empirical work in calling the Company’s Texas HQ (LoL)

**// What the heck is Microvast?**

Founded by Yang Wu in 2006, **Microvast is focused on driving mass adoption EVs** and its battery technology boasts best-in-class charging speed, battery life, energy density and safety performance. Key takeaway:

* **In a nutshell**: headquartered in Houston (TX, USA), 6 locations worldwide and +2,500 employees. Over 700+ R&amp;D staff (30+ PhDs, and 100+ master degree). Over 426 patents and patent applications which covers the whole Li-ion battery chain, including battery material (cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte), cell, pack, BMS, powertrain, and related equipment
* **10 mins, faster than you**: the Company has been an innovative industry leader for over a decade and has clear visibility to future growth from its existing pipeline across commercial markets including e- buses, vans, trucks, passenger vehicles, automated guided vehicles, forklifts and mining trucks. They have a battery system that enables 10 minute charging times with limited degradation based on lithium-titanate technology (game-changer, Toshiba apparently the only very-close competitor)
* **Vertical Integration**: its strategy extends from core battery chemistry, including cathode and anode materials, electrolyte, and membrane separators, to application technologies including battery management systems (BMS) and other power electronics. Higher quality, lower costs as by integrating the process from raw material to system assembly, Microvast is able to provide customized solutions with reduced project development time and controllable cost
* **Strategic growth**: as of October 2020, the Company had more than 40,000 electric vehicles powered by Microvast battery systems operating in 170+ cities within 19 countries, which have accumulated over 4 billion kilometers driving distance without any operation accidents caused by batteries. Plus, an impressive, growing list of global OEM customers, and a strategic partnership with Fiat Power Train Industrial. Bottom line is: real products with real-world adoptions (E-buses in China, London, Germany Singapore), and strong focus on R&amp;D and diversification in terms of regional coverage which makes it less prone to regulatory risks or investigations (e.g. Chinese Probes). Notably, electric buses during the 2018 Olympic Games in South Korea featured Microvast batteries
* **No real financial available** (🚩). Nonetheless, take or leave it, Mr Wu (founder and CEO) stated “Microvast expects to generate over $100 million of revenue this financial year. Our potential transition into a public company will help continue to fuel our design and development of market-leading ultra-fast charging, long-life battery power systems”
* **Real production sites and product dev** (🟢): Microvast started its Li-ion battery production in Huzhou, China since 2009, automatic cell production line (Phase II) and automatic module production with semi-automatic pack production line (Phase II) in place. Phase I and II in operation since 2009, Phase III started its construction since Mar 2017
* **Clean City Transit project with an ultra-fast charging network**: the CCT plan put forward by Microvast is based on fast charging, long life and safe battery technology, and aims to facilitate the electrification of urban transport systems by progressively introducing battery systems while minimizing disruption to urban infrastructure, first to city buses, then to taxis and finally to passenger cars

**// Ok so what should I buy? THCB**

* **THCB** is a blank-check company initially aiming to bring a cannabis company public. Then, they decided to switch to the EV space following the trends we all know. The Chairman and CEO stated “Microvast has a compelling financial profile, with significant historical revenues as well as projected growth and profitability”. Total valuation exceeds $2Bn
* 75 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission. These institutions hold a total of 39,345,200 shares. Largest shareholders include BlueCrest Capital Management Ltd, Mizuho Securities Usa Llc, Bank Of Montreal /can/, Hudson Bay Capital Management LP, K2 Principal Fund, L.p., Cnh Partners Llc, Polar Asset Management Partners Inc., Alberta Investment Management Corp, Sage Rock Capital Management LP, and Periscope Capital Inc
* In March 2019, the Company consummated its IPO from which it derived gross proceeds of $276,000,000 (including $36,000,000 from the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option). Like most blank check companies, the charter provides for the return of the IPO proceeds held in the trust account to the holders of public shares if there is no qualifying business combination(s) consummated on or before a certain date (in this case, December 7, 2020 or above, see below)
* On December 3, **THCB** will vote a proposal to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from December 7, 2020 to April 30, 2021
* EarlyBirdCapital has been the sole book-running manager and underwriter. The previous merger consumed by EarlyBirdCapital are significant. The latest include TTCF (+59%), VLDR (+55%), BWMX (+204%), AVCT (-42%) and (-16%)

**// Don't fuck with me, what are the risks?**

The completion of the transaction is subject to, among other things, the execution of a **definitive agreement** (which has already taken place for //AvePoint instead, see my other post) approval by the two companies' boards, satisfaction of customary closing conditions and approval of the transaction by each company's shareholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be entered into or that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the terms currently contemplated or at all. If a legally binding definitive agreement is entered into, a full description of the terms of the transaction will be provided in a registration statement and/or a proxy statement of SPAC to be filled with the SEC

**// I don't want to read, bottom line? TL;DR**

* **Microvast considers itself a leader in developing ultra-fast and long-lasting battery power systems for electric vehicles**, around since 2006. Unlike other companies involved in SPAC deals, **Microvast has developed an existing product** (electric buses during the 2018 Olympic Games in South Korea, Shanghai, London, Germany, China and Auckland)
* After hours trading on Wednesday 25/11 saw a +12%, while the trading day closed slightly positive with no significant spike. **Business combination hasn’t been approved**, we have just an LoI, which amplifies the risk of a no deal as the two haven’t entered a definite agreement
* \+7.40% on Friday 27/11, **still very manageable price**. I would buy at retracement S1 or R1 for the true autists, monitor the proxy statement vote on Dec 3, forget about it all the way until other rumors about the business combination. Looking at the EV space, after a news I would TP 60% capital invested TP @ +20%. Look at the overall market conditions in Dec/Jan (depending on the business combination) and TP the remaining @ +40% upside

Back in May 22, BABA stated that they would likely be able to comply with U.S. Securities Rules: [](

The issue that I am seeing is that companies like BABA, NIO, etc. are audited by PwC LLP/PwC China and the PCAOB here in the US are unable to verify their work/procedures. In fact, this is explicitly stated in BABA's annual reports:

*PricewaterhouseCoopers, our auditor, is required under U.S. law to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, without approval from the Chinese government authorities,* ***the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections of the audit work and practices of PCAOB-registered audit firms within the PRC on a basis comparable to other non-U.S. jurisdictions****. Since we have substantial operations in the PRC, our auditor and its audit work are currently not fully inspected by the PCAOB.*

This looks like an issue out of BABA's control -- **is this not an issue between PwC China and U.S./PCAOB, not BABA**? Thus, I ask again -- are companies like BABA screwed?

0,k37y63,"Have the rules of the ""game"" already changed?","Okay, I am aware that I might get a looot of downvotes on this one. But even if this happens, the idea of this post is to sparkle a good discussion and conversations. And I am just sharing my thoughts. You might also notice that I'm not someone, who has been investing for 20+ years, but rather than 2+.

Recently I finished reading ""The Intelligent Investor"". It was the newer version with comments after every chapter, which are referring to ""modern day"" examples (very helpful). Amazing book, without a doubt. I'd recommend it to everyone. I would even read it one more time at some point.

In a very very short summary, the book teaches the following things:

1. Always check the fundamentals: read the yearly reports of a company for at least the last past 5 years. Always read the reports back to forth, because in the back usually they put the information nobody wants to see (debt, losses etc.).
2. Don't buy a stock only, because it's overhyped.
3. Don't assume that stocks only go up. 
4. It's much safer to invest in index funds and ETFs than in individual stocks.
5. It's much safer to invest long-term than short or mid-term.
6. 6% to 10% returns per year is the key. If you are getting more, you are doing something wrong (because it would be an indication that it's too risky and could crash any moment).

Etc. etc. you get it. 

While and after reading the book, one question couldn't get out of my mind: 

**Is everything in this book still relevant today?**

Doing your own DD and learning the fundamentals of a company is here to stay forever. This is for sure and everybody should learn it.

But I have to admit, I didn't know anything about the stocks I bought so far. I didn't even check their websites. And I made around 25k since June 2020 (the first time in my life buying a single stock): financial gain which is crucial for my current situation in life. I was always following the ""herd-behavior"" in the sub-reddits and bought what everyone else bought: NIO, TSLA, PLTR, WKHS, KODAK, KNDI, MODERNA, GME etc. And yes, I paid a few more dollars in fees by selling and rebuying again short-time, in order to secure profits. 

**How is this different from the time-period when ""The Intelligent Investor"" was written?**

I was written in 1949. Back then people didn't have access to relevant information like now. Not even back then, but up until the mid-end of the 90s. Even through the beginning of the 2000s access internet was still being rolled out.

Using the investment advice from the book ""buy once and never sell for the next 40 years"" is absolutely relevant for the 40s, 50s, 60s etc. You literally didn't have any other choice, because of the extremely high broker fees and no access to real-time information.

**What about today?**

I have the feeling that the situation today is a bit different. Almost every broker on the internet has little to no fees. You can get real-time alerts by a simple setting in ""google alerts"". And of course, there is RobinHood, where every kid nowadays can buy and sell as much as he wants. And you have a little device in your pocket, where you can monitor and control your portfolio 24/7.

I have 2 ETF positions (S&amp;P 500 and MSCI World) and I put monthly 200$ in them. It's been 2 years since I have them and I haven't touched them since. However, the gains are not so impressive compared to the stocks, which are being discussed here. 

I'm not going to sell my ETFs. However, I just have the feeling that I made good money exactly by NOT following the advices from the bible of investing ""The Intelligent Investor"". And of course, there is no guarantee that this will continue to happen in the future. I am just saying that holding ETFs for 2+ years and doing nothing haven't worked out for me so far, compared to concentrating on single stocks for short- and mid-term.

**Disclaimer:** this is not the result of a scientific study and is based solely on my own experiences with investing so far.   


* What are your experiences regarding long vs. short/mid-term?  

* Is there someone here, who is actually still holding an ETF or index fund since 10/20+ years and can share some thoughts on the feeling of having it?

0,k3lb03,Funds and stocks: bifurcated automatic investment,"I invest heavily in index funds, but have a non-trivial percentage set aside for individual stocks as well.

I know exactly what percentage of my portfolio should be allocated to each fund or individual stock. Ideally, every month when I get my paycheck, I would check the current allocations and invest where necessary to get things as close to their targets as possible.

**Is there a way to automate this in one central tool?**

Alternatively, **how can there not be?**

This need seems so common that a solution must exist, but I haven't been able to find it. If I only cared about my Vanguard index funds, I could manage that easily enough through Vanguard with no fees. And for individual stocks, it seems like I could use Robinhood or M1, although Robinhood recurring investments seem to be based on fixed amounts instead of target percentages.

Going with two different systems isn't terrible by any means, but it does mean that I will need to dedicate a fixed amount to each system every month. If my individual stocks underperform against the indices, they will remain underrepresented until I go in and fix things manually.

0,k2rwxq,APXT // AvePoint - Legit Analysis,"Read first, thank me later. **AvePoint, the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider, Announced a $2bn Merger in a definite business combination with Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation** (NASDAQ: APXT). The post-closing entity will be listed on NASDAQ under new ticker AVPT and maintain the AvePoint name. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Apex, as well as the Board of Directors of AvePoint and it is expected to finalise in Q1 2021

**// About AvePoint**

AvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:

* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way
* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company’s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC). The Company sells directly to large and mid-market enterprises, and its solutions are also available to managed services providers on more than 100 cloud marketplaces globally. Regarding Microsoft, the company “Bridges the Gap Between What Microsoft Cloud Offers and What the Enterprise Requires”
* Compared to other recent SPAC deals and business combinations we just saw, AvePoint has indeed a great track record. Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022
* Great market trends. Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fuelled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends
* The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs. The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before the reverse merger announcement

**// About APXT**

* Apex’s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners. Implied enterprise value of 9.0x 2021E revenue with very attractive valuation multiples compared to peers

**// Advisors**

Evercore Group L.L.C., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC, Evercore and Cowen In

**// TL;DR - Bottom line**

* AvePoint is a Market leading SaaS company, with powerful tailwinds for Microsoft Cloud, a high quality and diversified customer base and compelling historical &amp; expected financial results, business model and valuation
* APEX after hours trading on Wednesday 25/11 saw a +19.20%, while the trading day closed slightly positive with no significant spike. Business combination already approved means less risk on that side (if compared to Tuscan for instance) but very huge upside potential
* Pre-market stands @ +10%. I would buy R1, forget about it all the way to 80% capital invested TP @ \~+30%. Look at the overall market conditions in Dec and TP the remaining funds @ +60% upside. But I’m less degenerate than you guys are

0,k3epo2,DD on $APL.V (APPULSE CORP). VALUE TRAP OR SURE LONG TERM WIN?!? Centrifuge business in the wake of a vaccine boom!,"CONTEXT:  
APPULSE Corp. is a centrifuge manufacturing company traded on the Vancouver stock exchange at 0,44$. It makes, sells, and rents centrifuges and centrifuge parts. It also provides maintenance services for said centrifuges.

I'm a new millenial investor, started to get interested in stocks since a year and a half and trying to learn the fundamentals. I found this stock while looking for value investments cause the idea of pumping even more money in the Tech bubble made me want to puke. I'm really interested if you guys have any insight on this company or investing in general. I bought this company for around 2% of my portfolio as some kind of a risky gamble for the following reasons:  


PROS FOR $APL.V BULLISH POSITION:

1) STEADY EARNINGS SINCE 2015 AND INSANE EARNINGS GROWTH SINCE EARLY 2019

Total revenues as of sept 2020 11.486mil. Earnings 1.254mil for a 10.9% profit margin. That gives an insane earnings growth 215% in the last year. This seems like a quite reliable company earnings wise since they've had stable positive earnings since 2015. Moreover, since early 2019, earnings have jumped on a cocaine trampoline, growing from 168k end of 2018 to 1.254mil as of sept 2020, with a profit margin rising from 1.7% to 10.9%)

2) P/E ratio 4.8x

Considering the Canadian Machinery Industry average P/E of 25.5x and average Canadian market P/E of 15.6x, this company looks highly undervalued according to P/E alone. 

3) P/B ratio 1.2x

Canadian Machinery industry average of 2.8x. Which means that this company is trading at roughly around the price of it's overall assets, the current market price takes no account of the reliable and growing earnings as well as the excellent company health/good handling of debt.

4) GREAT FINANCIAL HEALTH

Debt to equity ratio of 24.5% as of sept 2020 which is reasonable. Debt to equity ratio has reduced significantly from 37.8% to 24.5% in the past 5 years. Their short and long term liabilities are very well covered by their short term assets. This seems like a company who knows how to handle their debt.

5) COVID vaccines!!

I don't really know who the mains clients of that business are, but all I know is that centrifuges are essential to make vaccines. Millions and millions of new vaccine doses are gonna be prepared in the next few years, people are gonna need centrifuges. That earnings growth is certainly not going down for a least the next 2 years boys.

&amp;#x200B;

CONS FOR $APL.V BULLISH POSITION

This is a small cap company with a market cap of 6.092mil only. The stock has virtually no volume at all.

This is where it gets me kinda sad. This looks to me like an overwhelmingly undervalued company. If you don't even consider growth, it should be valued at around 2 to 3$ a share based on P/E and P/B alone. Is there ANY way this company could gain in share price without pumping it out of proportion as a pump and dump scheme?!? And as a larger question, is there any point at all in investing in penny stocks/small caps?!?

Thanks for the advice!",21,510,dd apl v appulse corp value trap sure long term win centrifuge business wake vaccine boom,context appulse corp centrifuge manufacturing company traded vancouver stock exchange make sell rent centrifuge centrifuge part also provides maintenance service said centrifuge new millenial investor started get interested stock since year half trying learn fundamental found stock looking value investment cause idea pumping even money tech bubble made want puke really interested guy insight company general bought company around portfolio kind risky gamble following reason pro apl v bullish position steady earnings since insane earnings growth since early total revenue sept mil earnings mil profit margin give insane earnings growth last year seems like quite reliable company earnings wise since stable positive earnings since moreover since early earnings jumped cocaine trampoline growing k end mil sept profit margin rising p e ratio x considering canadian machinery industry average p e x average canadian market p e x company look highly undervalued according p e alone p b ratio x canadian machinery industry average x mean company trading roughly around price overall asset current market price take account reliable growing earnings well excellent company health good handling debt great financial health debt equity ratio sept reasonable debt equity ratio reduced significantly past year short long term liability well covered short term asset seems like company know handle debt covid vaccine really know main client business know centrifuge essential make vaccine million million new vaccine dos gonna prepared next year people gonna need centrifuge earnings growth certainly going least next year boy amp x b con apl v bullish position small cap company market cap mil stock virtually volume get kinda sad look like overwhelmingly undervalued company even consider growth valued around share based p e p b alone way company could gain share price without pumping proportion pump dump scheme larger question point penny stock small cap thanks advice

The story made multiple outlets when Solidium crossed the 5% threshold to 5.01% in September, sparking speculation of Finland trying to defend against US interest. At that time, Finland said they were done buying, “From a European perspective, it’s important that Europe has 5G technology. But Europe isn’t an entity who could buy shares,” Makinen said. “For the Finnish state, it boils down to this: it’s one of the most -- if not the most -- important company in Finland and keeping it Finnish has value to us.”

Solidium won’t disclose plans of further purchases, and Makinen said the 5% it now has “feels like a suitable amount.”

Good morning/evening everyone. The poll closed out (on r/dividends) with Walmart placing 2nd and Honeywell placing last, so these two will get stock reviews, starting today with Wal-Mart.

# Walmart | Save Money - Live Better:

Sector: Consumer Defensive

Walmart is America’s largest retailer by sales, selling a variety of general merchandise and grocery items. It operates 11,300 stores in the US, which account for approx 76% of sales in fiscal 2019, with Mexico and Central America \~6%, the UK \~6%, and Canada \~4% beings  its largest external markets.

The company operates several e-commerce properties apart from its site, including Flipkart, Jet.com, and shoes.com (it also owns a roughly 10% stake in Chinese online retailer JD.com). As of 2019, e-commerce accounted for only \~5% of fiscal 2019 sales. However the e-sales growth during the pandemic has greatly increased this.

Walmart has been smart with its acquisitions and partnerships. Walmart has partnerships with Instacard, ThredUp, Shopify, and even Google. The Instacart partnership, together accounts for nearly half of all online grocery sales in 2020. The partnership with Thredup allows Walmart to sell cheaper clothes on its online marketplace, and Shopify allows 3rd party sellers to sell their goods on Walmart's marketplace as well. Lastly, the Google partnership provides customers voice-enabled grocery shopping and likely much more in the future. Walmart's partnerships and acquisitions are taken to further complete with and provide a market alternative to Amazon.

**Strengths:**

&gt;\- Walmart is the largest retailer in the world providing it unequaled power to leverage their vendor's, suppliers, and manufacturers, keeping prices low with national and private brands.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Walmart's cost advantage provides significant barrier to entry and is consistently used to disrupt their competitors.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The company is aggressively investing in its e-commerce segment and focused on strategic acquisitions to complete with Amazon. (Mentioned in the last paragraph above)  
&gt;  
&gt;\-  The partnership with Google is has the potential to be particularly strong due to Walmart lacking strong tech exposure.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Walmart PLUS memberships, 2 hour delivery, and expansion into drone delivery services.

**Risks:**

&gt;\-  Walmart employs millions people and is facing intense pressure to raise wages. This will have an effect on their profit margins.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Amazon. Amazon is much much more than just e-commerce.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Walmart's profit margins aren't as wide as they could be due to keeping prices lower, this does bring them more sales revenue, but they have to be very wary of any competitors lowering their prices further to undermine Walmart's position and margins.

Amazon's threat to many of the traditional brick and mortar industries cannot be understated. Amazon's model is nearly the example of a monopsony, the opposite of a monopoly. They aren't interested in dominating one sector, but ingraining themselves into literally everything. This is why Amazon's model is so disruptive.

In addition to this, Amazon is often the company that raises the conversation of wage increases to undermine it's competitors. The wage increase to 15$ was much more than them ""listening to their critics"", it was a move to further pressure any of their competitors whose margins cannot effectively absorb this cost burden. This tactic, along with Walmarts cheap pricing tactics, is what allows Amazon to nab up companies very cheap. (See the whole diapers deal).

# Financial History:

For Walmart we will be looking at the 5 year financials rather than the 10 year due to their push more recently to get into the ecommerce markets.

|2018|$495,761|$30,966|$46,470|\~1.5|

|2020|$523,964|$31,555|$72,400|\~2.3|

The revenue is honestly just insane and shows how large Walmart is, plus it is something like 80-90% of the US population lives within 15 miles of a Walmart or something? Anyways, $478 Billion to $523 Billion, about an average increase of 2.2% YoY. Not bad, they are continuing to grow, but just ahead of currently inflation rates. When we look at EBITDA though, their margins are shrinking/lumpy.  This, based on the company movement, and from what they say in their 10K, this decrease is largely attributed to them moving into e-commerce. These numbers may be significantly different next year since their ecommerce has been growing pretty significantly during the pandemic, they are estimated at 97% annual growth there. However note that ecommerce, despite this increase is still a very small piece of the company right now, it is going to take awhile for it to have a more significant impact, but the growth is absolutely there.

The debt is increasing due to acquisitions as well as investment into the ecommerce segment as well. The 2.3x debt/earnings is a bit higher than their historic levels, but again, they are investing right now, and it is still lower than a 3x where it starts to be a bit more concerning.

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|$28,337|$10,051|$16,840|
|2019|$27,753|$10,344|$29,444|
|2020|$25,255|$10,705|$13,479|

Cash flow from operations is definitely in line with the decreasing EBITDA so that makes sense. Their CAPEX been consistent the last few years, nothing to really note there since the e-market stuff has already been mentioned. Now for the Free Cash Flow, in 2019 there is a significant jump, this is because in 2019 they took on \~$12 Billion in debt load, this was added to the FCF/E for whatever reason, we can subtract it and say that is was more likely \~$15/16/17 Billion, which is in line with the decline. In 2018 and 2020 they were making debt payments, appears to be about 1.5 Billion for each of those years, hence the lower FCF/E there.

Over the years, in addition to the dividend, they do appear to be using some of their capital to buy back shares, those have decreased from approx 3,200 - 2,850 outstanding over the last 5 years or so. Some would say this is the better way to give back to the shareholders rather than dividends, but others say that it is a way for companies to create synthetic earnings. Take what you will from that. Typically healthy (large) companies will do both dividends and share buybacks, so take what you will from that.

# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:

Walmart (WMT) is a Dividend Aristocrat that has paid and increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years.

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Stock Price|$151.60|
|:-|:-|
|P/E Ratio|21.89|
|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.16|
|Yield|1.42% (Based on  $151.60 Price Nov 2020)|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|7.2%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|1.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|34.45%|

Strictly from a Dividend Growth perspective, the payout is a bit low and the dividend growth has sharply decreased as the company continues to focus on e-market expansion. In addition to this, the yield on cost is of lower value right now, had the stock been purchased earlier when it's price was closer to 100$, it would have been an excellent buy, at the current price and yield though, there are better prospects.

From a value perspective... well Walmart over the years has traded closer to an 8x multiple, it is currently over 20x. Based on this alone it would be considered overvalued based on its financials, however one also needs to consider that higher multiples are typically paid for companies with stronger growth prospects...which leads us to growth.

From a growth perspective, Walmart is a market titan, the growth will be gradual over longer periods of time, but there are many factors that need to be considered from this perspective (as well as the others):

&gt;\- Will their e-market investments pay off or will they lose market share due to more competitors in the business and pressure from Amazon?  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Will the decline of brick and mortar stores offset the earnings from the e-market?  
&gt;  
&gt;\- How much could they expand their margins by automating warehouses amoung other segments?  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Do their traditional brick and mortar stores provide Walmart a significant distribution advantage over Amazon? (80-90% of Americans within 15 miles of a Walmart mentioned above)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- How will Wamart continue to nurture their relationships with Google and Microsoft and will it continue to make smart and strategic acquisitions?  
&gt;  
&gt;\- How will future government policies and labor unions affect both Amazon and Walmart?

There are so many different unknowns that need to be considered.

# Closing Thoughts:

Walmart is an absolute titan of a company that is transitioning to have a significant e-market presence. Compared to Amazon, Walmart is currently the underdog that still needs to be very cognizant of it's other competitors, like Target. However, their recent partnerships and acquisitions have enabled the company to expand significantly online during the pandemic, and unlike Amazon, they have a wider physicals presence, stores that can act as distribution centers amoung other things.

Ultimately, Amazon is very likely to continue to dominate, however, Walmart does have the potential to start edging their way into the different market segments and start taking pieces of the pie for itself. Amazon is certainly aware of this, hence the reason it pushes timely wage-increases and other policies to undermine its competitors. Government policy is a significant factor to both due to their sheer size and presence.

At the end of it all, you need to ask yourself, do you think Walmart can continue compete, and continue to work its current business model? Or perhaps you'd take more the side of why not both?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. There are always more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views, read up on Target and Amazon. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.

0,k371wj,The '08 crash,"We have all seen The Big Short, Margin Call, Inside Job, that new documentary with Bush, Bernanke and Greenspan etc. that gives a pretty good picture on what led to the '08-09 crash. But I've always thought that's only half of the picture, and a bit washed out and simplified story of a complex situation in a very complex world.

One theory I've heard from a trader years ago is something that has always stuck with me and I've never seen or heard anyone mentioning it again. He said something along the lines of (can't remember word for word) - the crash actually happened because the banks had the MBS assets as Tier 1 capital on their books and when the assets got downgraded, they couldn't keep the assets as Tier 1 anymore and that froze up their credit. So they had to sell. And that the actual default rate on mortgages at the time was something like 5%.

I know in the end it's the same thing, but I've never seen or heard anyone mention that aspect of it, and it makes a lot of sense. I've searched for it on the internet but haven't found a good answer.

The Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) will fund the merger by raising $200 million from new equity issues, Bloomberg’s sources suggested. Reportedly, the merger would create a new entity with a total valuation exceeding $2 billion.
Green: Bullish+lets talk bout it
ALL BOLD IS IMPORTANT BUT MOST OF IT IS NICE TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO BE LONG

They are in talks with MICROVAST which, a couple brokers even stated that it actually is a done deal, but things can be lost in translation,they will have to extend for a DA(Definitive Agreement) for the merger acquisition(DECEMBER 3rd DEADLINE). BECAUSE THEY ARE A SPAC THAT IS NEARING THEIR EXPIRATION FOR ACQUIRING A STOCK, 2 YEARS, WHEN THEY DO THE 90 DAY EXTENSION THAT MEANS THEY ARE TRUSTING IT TO HAPPEN OR ELSE WHY EXTEND. GET IT? IT IS A GIVEN 13$ STOCK THAT IS A HUGE BATTERY EV COMPANY, UNDERVALUED.

ALL WE HAVE HEARD BETWEEN THESE TWO COMPANIES
BY TUSCAN (THCB)
""Microvast has a compelling financial profile, with significant historical revenues as well as projected growth and profitability(I can post that in end if i dont just ask but it is GOOD).  With its battery technology installed in over 28,000 vehicles worldwide, an impressive,  growing list of global OEM customers, and a strategic partnership with Fiat Power Train Industrial, Microvast is a proven technology leader driving the mass adoption of EVs.  We are excited to partner with Mr. Wu and his experienced team and believe the valuation negotiated provides long term intrinsic value to Tuscan shareholders.  We look forward to supporting Microvast in its next phase of growth as a public company,"" said Stephen Vogel, Chairman and CEO of Tuscan.
BY MICROVAST CEO
Yang Wu, Microvast's founder, Chairman and CEO added: ""Our potential transition into a public company will help continue to fuel our design and development of market-leading ultra-fast charging, long-life battery power systems. Microvast expects to generate over $100 million of revenue this financial year. With the automotive technology experience and capital this transaction with Tuscan is intended to provide, we are confident we can build upon our established success and accelerate our growth in the electric vehicle battery industry.""

For now I will further explain what MICROVAST is

MICROVAST has majority owned joint ventured companies( CHINA STATE GRID + Hengtong eBus Power Systems Co. Ltd. ) TWO SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES
CEO= Wu Yang:Wu is a visionary leader and entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience in entrepreneurship and technology development
Microvast, whose batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year, its founder Yang Wu said in a statement.
Read below for Info about them and Microvast
Founded in 2006 by Wu Yang, Microvast, Inc. is a completely vertically integrated advanced power and technology company. Microvast offers advanced power solutions for applications such as electric vehicles, grid scale energy storage, and industrial products.  Microvast advanced LpTO batteries operate with high charge and discharge rates making them ideal for route based electric vehicle and grid scale energy storage applications.
Apr 30, 2012
Microvast Opens World’s First Ultra-fast Charging Station
Microvast is pleased to announce that the world’s first commercial, ultra fast charge, electric vehicle charging station began operations today.  The electric bus charging station was jointly developed by Microvast and the China State Grid and is operated in Chongqing, China, where traditional bus commuter traffic exceeds 4 million rides per day ( in 2012.... lol, much more now)
Each charger fills the bus battery in 5 to 10 minutes, functioning like a conventional gas station as opposed to a typical “Park &amp; Charge” charging station

 
About  CHINA STATE GRID
State Grid Corporation of China is the largest electric utility in the world. For distribution, it has subsidiaries in Northern, Northeastern, Eastern, Central, and Northwestern China. It was ranked seventh of the world’s largest companies by revenue in the 2011 Fortune Global 500 list.


Current companys locations and progressions  2014-2021
Microvast Locations
USA,CHINA,GERMANY, UK
In the early half of 2019, Microvast made new breakthroughs by entering Russia, South Korea, Kazakhstan, India, Thailand, New Zealand, Singapore, etc.
It is revealed that its overseas revenue this year is expected to triple compared with that in 2018 thanks to its impressive expansion in Southeast Asian market.
The battery maker completed building a production facility in Ludwigsfelde, Germany in July, Inas reported by Electrive. Operations in this facility are expected to commence in March 2021.
Ludwigsfelde is close to Brandenburg — a state that is attracting electric carmakers and battery producers alike. Tesla Inc’s
 is building a technologically advanced and high-volume production unit. Whereas, the German multinational company BASF SE 
BASFY 
 is also setting up a production site to make battery materials, as per Reuters.
The International Airport Charging Station is the first of multiple planned (AND FINISHED BELOW)charging stations scheduled for Chongqing as part of the cities investment plan to develop an advanced electric public transport system with more than 1000 ultrafast charge EV buses.  “The Chongqing Fast Charge Technology is an important piece of Microvast’s innovative CCT (Clean City Transit) Solution.  Our technology, evaluated and demonstrated over the last year in six (6) prototype buses, is now ready for commercial operation in Chongqing.  The prototype buses have each driven more than 25,000 miles and we are confident in their continued performance.  By operating this new fast charge station, more and more people will take advantage of our green technology and move towards zero emissions,” said Wu Yang, President and CEO of Microvast, Inc.
HT eBus Power Systems Co., Ltd. has delivered 125 buses so far this year, and will produce up to 1,000 BEV and PHEV buses for Chongqing, equipped with Microvast’s fast charging technology
The ultrafast charge station is FINISHED AND located at the Chongqing International Airport New Development Zone and is utilized by a fleet of more than 30 full electric transit buses and additional plug-in hybrid electric buses.  The buses carry passengers from nearby high technology manufacturing areas to residential areas on 20 mile route and are powered by ultrafast charge Microvast LpTO batteries manufactured by Microvast Power Systems Co., Ltd., a Microvast subsidiary.


Forward Looking PR : With Microvast’s ultrafast charging technology, each bus takes only a few minutes to completely charge after each route; charging for the buses takes place multiple times each day as the buses transport passengers.
According to Lei Bingnan from Microvast, the company has already established cooperative ties with two major bus makers in India
In the early half of this year, Microvast made new breakthroughs by entering Russia, South Korea, Kazakhstan, India, Thailand, New Zealand, Singapore, etc.
Since its establishment, Microvast has been actively involved in the overseas expansion. In 2014, it officially entered London by securing an order for providing batteries to 1,000 units double-deckers. Later, it entered Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, etc.

0,k2fedc,Chinese stocks a step closer to getting removed from US due to auditing rules,"**TLDR**  *Your favorite Chinese stocks will be fine. [Nio](, [Xpev](, and BABA are all audited independently by Pricewaterhousecoopers. Earlier this year BABA's CFO said they [anticipate no problem]( with complying with US regulations.*


* * *

[WSJ reports](;page=1) that next week the House will consider a measure that will force Chinese companies traded on American exchanges to follow American auditing rules -- or face getting delisted.

This proposal has strong bipartisan support. The Senate version was passed unanimously. 

Reasons why it might not pass:

* Wall Street firms have made $1.4 billion in fees underwriting these banks.
* [US pension funds]( own a lot of these Chinese stocks.
* SEC general counsel Dan Goelzer thinks this is a way for US government to gain ""a lever"" in negotiations. Indicating that they are not expecting to go through with it, but rather to use it to get some reasonable accommodations from China.


Good news:

* If it passes it will give Chinese companies 3 years to comply. That's a long time for both countries to find some compromise.
* The worst case scenario is that the Chinese companies will fold your shares into the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. So you can still trade if you're on a platform that works with the HKSE. So no one is going to lose their shares.
* Rules like this may prevent future Luckin Coffee incidents. The increase in public trust in Chinese stocks might actually help their companies grow in the long run.

The biggest companies hit will be the directly state-owned companies. They will probably never say yes to US auditing. You can find a list of China [state-owned companies here \(PDF\)]( -- they are the companies with asterixis next to their names. 

Note the most popular Chinese stocks are not state-owned: BABA, JD, PDD, NTES, NIO, TME, YUMC, IQ, LI, XPEV, WB, DOYO, JKS, NIU, KNDI, and BYD.

**Analysis**

When this news hit the general public on Monday, you will see at 3-5% drop in some Chinese stocks. People are not going to read the entire article. They are just going to read the headline and start panicking. I think this represents a good opportunity to buy the dip on some of these companies, especially BABA -- which is criminally undervalued, and BYD -- the best EV play and Warren Buffett stock that no one is talking about.

0,k2nqqx,Stock Advisors never seem to come to the same conclusion,"Have you ever noticed that? 

After reading through dozens of lists recommending different stocks, made by some of the most recognisable names in the field, I've never seen two list the same stock. Which, I think, is strange isn't it? If those top advisors are going by the numbers, or assessing the future performance of different stocks properly, then shouldn't at least a few of those advisors come to a similar conclusion with their results?

Shouldn't at least five advisors from, let's say, one hundred suggest RollsRoyce or Microsoft for a great growth stock (Examples of course).

I was thinking about that because, hypothetically, if more than two Advisors recommended the same stock between the three of them, (taking into account each advisor might use separate means of reaching their answer) then shouldn't that be a bonafide investment strategy for anyone to follow?

0,k2xggy,Impact of debt repurchase on leverage,"Hi folks, 
The corporate bond market has seen a wave of refinancing whereby companies that issued debt  back in March 2020 at very high coupons are calling these issues and issuing new bonds at much lower rates. How does this affect the balance sheet and leverage ratios?

It seems to me that if a company issued a $100 bond at par, we would see $100 in assets and 100 in liabilities. We would also see a 100 flow in the cash flow from financing.

Let’s say that the company calls those bonds at $150 because rates and spreads are now very much lower. Let’s further say that they borrow this $150 from the bond market. In this case, we would now have 150 in assets, 150 in liabilities, and a net cash from financing flow of 150-100 = 50. There would be no expense on the income statement immediately, but going forward the interest expense would be lower as rates are now very much lower. This reduction in interest rates and interest expense is why a company would refinance in the first place, even though the balance sheet now looks more leveraged with 150 in debt.

Is this accurate?

0,k34pwp,Doing a roughshod DCF and I need help understanding multiples after calculating out a per share value,"Okay so I'm doing a roughshod DCF on L Brands ($LB) because I'm starting to think they're cheap right now due to the pandemic. I'm utter trash when it comes to math, let alone investing math which is more made up than people want to think, so DCFs leave me in a cold sweat at night over how bad I am at the underlying math. For the denominator I tried three different scenarios with 10%, 12%, and 15%. Why those numbers? Because if your discount rate has to be the weighted average cost of capital and I know that $LB has had a history of 30.1% ROIC over the past 10 years then I can sit down and think that their cost of capital is much lower than this (this is intellectually lazy of me to do right now but I'm not exactly interested in doing a granular DCF for $LB). And also more or less it's a lot of finger wagging in the air. I took a 3 year average FCF (FCF=CFFO-capex just to be precise here) and got a range:    

Using 10%: $29,555,012,827.51, divided by 277K shares outstanding as of their most recent 10-K, gets me $106.70 a share.

Using 12%: $27,504,690,691.92, $99.29 a share 

Using 15%: $25,087,756,948.48, $90.57 a share.

I did 6 years of FCF projections for each of these (all the cash flows decline after year 1 and I don't fully understand why this is the case but they do) and then added all of them together to get the lump sum billions that are provided here. I have zero clue if this is how you do a DCF in any capacity, notwithstanding the clearly roughshod way that I'm going about it. Once I get here, how do I figure out what their estimated P/E would be? What their FCF yields would be? Other valuation multiples? How do I get there from what I just did? This is what trips me up when it comes to projecting future anything about a company. I don't know how to think in multiples very easily.

0,k1qvku,Key Takeaways from the Airbnb IPO filing,"Hi everyone,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb's S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks

On Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $30 billion. This is up from Airbnb's most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.

Airbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:

&gt;*"" “Airbnb” has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale.""*

But, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That’s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb’s recent S-1 filing:

(\****Note:*** *In case you’re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)*

1. Airbnb is a resilient business

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb’s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March. However by August, GBV was only down 14% when compared to August 2019. This impressive recovery shows how strong Airbnb’s business is.

For the 9 months ending September 2020, Airbnb posted a revenue drop of 32% when compared with the first 9 months of 2019. While this is a concern, the cut to sales and marketing expenditure at the same time points to a business that is quite resilient - In the same time period that revenue dropped by 32%, Airbnb cut its sales and marketing spend by a massive 54%. The ability to cut sales and marketing spend by over half while only having a revenue drop of 32% (in the middle of a pandemic) points to a business that is highly resilient with strong brand and customer loyalty.

2. Post-Covid travel patterns may benefit Airbnb

If we compare the gross nights and experiences booked on Airbnb to Airbnb’s gross booking value (GBV), we see an interesting pattern. Gross bookings in August are down 28% YoY while GBV is only down 14%. This means that the average spend on an individual booking has actually trended up this year! To further validate this point, long-term stays were down only 13% this year, compared to 81% for short-term stays. There was actually YoY growth for long-term stays from May to September. The importance of long-term stays is highlighted by the quote below:

&gt;*“We believe the long-term stays category represents a different use case than leisure travel, and as a result, was not as impacted as dramatically by COVID-19.”*

Long-term stays are a distinct competitive advantage for Airbnb and if trends continue they could drive a lot of long-term growth.

Airbnb has also highlighted a number of other categories that have performed particularly well this year. In particular, ‘domestic travel’, ‘short-distance travel’ and ‘travel outside top 20 cities’ have performed very well. For example, short-distance travel grew a whopping 38% YoY in September.

No doubt these trends will reverse somewhat as we exit the pandemic. However, it is unlikely they will reverse fully. If these trends maintain decent momentum, they represent a shift in travel patterns that uniquely benefits Airbnb and provides a significant competitive advantage.

3. Strong customer retention and brand loyalty

One of the most striking figures from the S-1 is that 91% of Airbnb’s traffic is organic, coming from direct and unpaid channels. This is very impressive. Airbnb has built an incredible brand and clearly has strong brand loyalty.

&gt;*“Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019.”*

Customer engagement and retention are also impressively high on the platform. In 2019, 68% of guests left a review of their stay. 69% of revenue generate in 2019 was from repeat guests.

Airbnb also has very strong retention among their host community. In 2019, 84% of revenue came from people who had hosted in 2018. This shows that the majority of hosts are staying on the platform and continuing to earn money through Airbnb.

4. International expansion is a big opportunity

Airbnb’s revenue growth has slowed over the last three years. It grew by 32% in 2019, down from 43% in 2018. While slowed growth is never great, 32% is quite healthy.

It remains to be seen what the impacts of Covid-19 will be on growth over the next few years. However, there seem to be big opportunities for international expansion which would allow Airbnb to maintain (and possibly improve) its growth rate.

Airbnb believes that its total addressable market is a whopping $3.4 trillion. While you can always take these predictions with a grain of salt, it is clear that Airbnb believes that a big part of this market opportunity lies outside the US and Europe. They highlight international expansion as a key part of their long-term growth strategy:

&gt;\*“\****Expand our global network.*** *We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence, as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower, such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and tens of thousands of smaller markets and remote areas around the world.”*

There are some encouraging signs that Airbnb has the potential to grow their international markets. They operate in 220 countries and importantly, 86% of their hosts are outside the US. International markets have also seen an increase in GBV and average nights per booking. In fact, Latin America has the highest average nights per booking of any region, at 4.1 nights. (North America is 3.7)

The strong customer loyalty previously mentioned, significant host presence in international markets (86%) and changing consumption patterns towards longer stays means that Airbnb has the potential to unlock a lot of value as they focus on international markets.

5. Regulation is a big concern

Regulation is a big risk for Airbnb. 70% of the company’s top 200 largest cities (by revenue) have implemented some form of regulation on short-term stays. For example, London has put a 90 nights per year limit on short term stays for properties without specific planning permission to do so.

Airbnb make it clear in the S-1 that the evolving regulatory situation is a cause for concern:

&gt;*“We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”*

Airbnb makes sure to point out that they are not dependant on any one city, region or country. For example, the US is the only country that represents over 10% of Airbnb’s revenue. While this may be true, the evolving regulatory environment does not seem to be going in Airbnb’s favour.

Investment Plan

*Please note that this is just an explanation of investing decisions for my personal portfolio and not a recommendation to anyone to buy/sell any stock.*

To make a decision on whether or not to invest in Airbnb, I believe there are 3 important questions to answer:

1. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?
2. What year should conclusions be based on?
3. What is a fair valuation?
4. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?

Although there are regulatory concerns, based on the above analysis I believe that Airbnb has strong upside potential.

2. What year should conclusions be based on?

The Airbnb S-1 is primarily focused on 2019 numbers. Airbnb believes that 2019 figures are the fairest reflection of the strength of the business. They believe that 2020 is a highly irregular year and that the company will rebound quickly post-covid. Investors should come up with their own conclusion on that but I agree with Airbnb that 2019 is a fair reflection of the business.

3. What is a fair valuation for Airbnb?

This is where things get tricky. In some ways, Airbnb doesn’t have any direct competitors to compare against. They are similar to both OTAs (online travel agents) and hotel chains like Hilton but obviously quite different in a number of ways too.

In my opinion, an interesting comparison is with Uber. While not exactly the same, Airbnb and Uber have a lot of similarities. They are both semi-marketplaces (Airbnb is closer to a true marketplace). Uber connects drivers with riders while Airbnb connects hosts with guests. They have a similar business model in that they both take a % of each transaction on their platform.

Obviously there are quite a few differences. In particular, Uber drivers are far more commoditised than Airbnb hosts. Uber also has more direct competition (Lyft).

Looking at 2019 figures for the fairest comparison, Uber is currently priced at roughly 6.33 times 2019 revenue. If we go with the analyst expected valuation of $30 billion, Airbnb would be valued at roughly 6 times 2019 revenue. Uber grew revenue 26% YoY in 2019 while Airbnb grew 32%.

With all of this in mind and particularly considering that Uber’s model is less defensible, I believe that the analyst-estimated $30 billion valuation represents a very good price for Airbnb.

What’s my plan?

My plan is to wait and see what happens on IPO day. If analysts are wrong and the stock pops above $40/50 billion, I won’t be purchasing and will wait to see what Airbnb’s performance is like over the next few months. If the stock settles at or below $30 billion, then I will definitely be adding it to my portfolio.

0,k2kgv4,Wash Sale Rule Triggered! Please help me understand,"If a wash sale rule triggered, will the date changes? Do I have to hold the for 30 or 60 more days to get out of this stupid rule? 

I currently have HYLN warrants, and I want to sell at a loss so I can write off taxes, but I innocently triggered  wash sale rule twice (thought I was safe to sell). Wonder what steps can I do. 

I think the best way is to hold these warrants? Though it would be annoying to convert them to shares, I would like to understand when can I sell for losses.

Background:
I purchased 300 warrants originally, then I sold some gains on SHLL shares to buy 100 more pre-converted HYLN (still SHLL)warrant around 10/1. Then I sold 18 days(ish) later to realize it would triggered a wash sale. That's fine.

0,k2q7fz,"""Value Investing"" and ""Chasing Value"" as described in books like Security Analysis will get you nowhere: a cautionary tale.","Guys, I started learning about investing in high school. As any precocious teenager, I decided to follow the example of investment heros Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. I read Security Analysis by Graham and Dodd. I devoured any book that purported to explain Buffet's strategy. Any book that described fundamental analysis. I read Berkshire's Annual reports, etc. I bought in, hook, line, and sinker. I was a total value and moat nerd.

Here's what an obsession over value investing did: when I had the opportunities to do so, I completely rejected investing in Amazon at $40/sh, Netflix $6/sh, Tesla $5/sh, Google $60/sh, and Apple $1.50/sh (all prices are post splits and prices listed were around the early 2000s). Instead I invested in companies in industries like insurance, banking, and transportation/logistics. Sure, I earned annual average return of 11%. But my opportunity costs have been astronomical. Thousands of percent of aggregate return on investment.

The underlying principle of value investment isn't wrong. All successful investments are in essence value investments in the sense that value is a function of mispricing. However, how one determines whether a mispricing has occurred is what led to me missing enormous opportunities. I myopically focused on financials, i.e. net earnings and primarily free cash flow, rather than focusing on innovation.

If there is a single lesson to learned from my experience is this: innovation &gt; financials. In hindsight, all the models I created using DCF analysis turned out to be useless and a complete waste of time.

I have since completely changed my strategies and I couldn't be happier with the results of my portfolio. Here's a piece of advice I learned from a professor whose main job was a wealth advisor and portfolio manager: If you are not earning 40% or more in annual returns from investing in stocks (including diversified options like ETFs and Index Funds) than your returns are not commensurate with the inherent risks of equity investing. You might as well not be invested in stocks at all. If you think 11% avg. annual returns is good enough, you are not accounting for risks and your actual risk-adjusted rate of return is negative.

Anyways, good luck and learn from my mistakes young padwan.

Edit: I just wanted to add one point. All those companies I missed out above were companies I'm not looking back at and wished I invested in (selection and hindsight biases). They were companies I literally wanted with all my heart to invest in at the time but refused to because of my adherence to value investing principles.

0,k2dddb,"Road and rail: YRCW has surged over the past two week or so, from around 2-3 dollars to around 6 dollars","I can't remember the exact numbers, so don't quote me, but it sits around six bucks and it was at around the 2-3 dollar mark when I was first looking at it. A metric I was looking at had them placed as one of the top road and rail companies and at the same time, a far cheaper buy than companies like Ryder, Universal, etc. On the one hand, their stock has fluctuated in the past, but they have a high growth ceiling to compare them to other companies in that market and have only grown since I've been watching them.

Another trucking company I was interested in was Universal, based on some information from my time contracting GM, seems to have stagnated a bit. What I had noticed during my time as a contractor was that Universal had taken over almost all the truck routes for the GM factory I was at. Whereas when I first started working at the factory, there were several different trucking companies that delivered and picked up parts for GM, Universal ended up picking up perhaps a majority of jobs. Also, it was rumored that GM's dedicated load, Ryder, who did their local parts delivery and pickup, was slated to be replaced by Universal, who was supposedly going to have a factory built for them by GM or funded in part by GM. At this point, I'm not sure if it was just a rumor, as I came to realize rumors abound at GM. However, Universal's stock seems to be stagnating and actually, Ryder is climbing; they are up to 60 dollars a stock, from 52 a few weeks back.

Anyway, anyone think YRCW or any other trucking companies are a good buy right now? One thing that gives me pause on YRCW is that, in spite of its climb, it isn't a new company and apparently its stock has risen and fallen over the years. But it at least seems like a solid short-term investment based on its growth.",21,334,road rail yrcw surged past two week around dollar around dollar,remember exact number quote sits around six buck around dollar mark first looking metric looking placed one top road rail company time far cheaper buy company like ryder universal etc one hand stock fluctuated past high growth ceiling compare company market grown since watching another trucking company interested universal based information time contracting gm seems stagnated bit noticed time contractor universal taken almost truck route gm factory whereas first started working factory several different trucking company delivered picked part gm universal ended picking perhaps majority job also rumored gm dedicated load ryder local part delivery pickup slated replaced universal supposedly going factory built gm funded part gm point sure rumor came realize rumor abound gm however universal stock seems stagnating actually ryder climbing dollar stock week back anyway anyone think yrcw trucking company good buy right one thing give pause yrcw spite climb new company apparently stock risen fallen year least seems like solid short term based growth

0,k1qzx8,Japan's Stock-Playing Central Bank Racks Up $56 Billion Gain,"One  of  Japan's  biggest stock investors just reported record gains of more than  $50 billion  after a well-timed bet. But the person who engineered the windfall won't be getting a  Wall Street -style bonus this holiday season, and some have even started saying he shouldn't play the market so much.

That's because the hot-hitting portfolio manager is Gov.  Haruhiko Kuroda , head of  Japan's  central bank. Mr. Kuroda has led the  Bank of Japan's  push, unusual among global central banks, to invest in the  Tokyo  stock market as a way of rousing the nation's animal spirits.

In March, he doubled the BOJ's annual ceiling for its purchases of exchange-traded funds to the equivalent of  $115 billion . That was the month the stock market began surging after a pandemic-induced dip. It closed Thursday at a 29-year high, up 60% from this year's low.

The superb timing helped the central bank report a record jump for a six- month period in its stock portfolio's gains when it released its semiannual financial report Thursday. It said the market value of its holdings stood at the equivalent of nearly  $400 billion  as of  Sept. 30 , which represented an unrealized profit of  $56 billion  over what it paid.

Six months earlier, the BOJ had barely any unrealized profit left, and at one point in March Mr. Kuroda said it was carrying large losses.

The stock-buying program, which began under Mr. Kuroda's predecessor a decade ago in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, isn't aimed at making trading profits. It is supposed to encourage broader risk-taking in the economy and ensure that prices are rising at a small and steady clip.

Recently, with inflation stuck around zero, some analysts are questioning whether the program is doing much good--especially during a pandemic, when other factors are weighing on the psychology of consumers and businesses.

Also, the central bank now owns more than 6% of the total value of the  Tokyo  stock market, leading some to wonder whether the premier symbol of capitalism could be undermined by state influence.

 NLI Research Institute  strategist  Shingo Ide  said the central bank's outsize role could hurt corporate governance because it can't act like other shareholders in monitoring company strategy and CEO performance.

""Because such a large unrealized profit means the bank's holdings are also getting bigger and bigger, there will likely be more demand from outside the BOJ to sell the stocks or start thinking about an exit policy,"" said Naomi Muguruma, an economist at  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities .

Ms. Muguruma said the BOJ would feel more comfortable starting such a discussion while it is sitting on profits.

The central bank doesn't directly buy individual stocks but invests in a swath of the market through exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. It bought  $15 billion  in ETFs in March alone, but the pace has slowed significantly in recent months as the market recovers.

Mr. Kuroda said last week that he wasn't thinking of any quick changes in the program, with the stock market one of the bright signs for an economy that is only halfway back from its pandemic bottom.

""We need to prevent any market instability from causing a worsening of business and household confidence,"" Mr. Kuroda told a parliamentary committee. "" The BOJ's ETF purchases were effective in easing instability caused by the impact of coronavirus infections.""

Still, there are signs that a rethink is in its early stages.  One  of the bank's nine policy board members, Takako Masai, said last week that the bank might have to consider tweaking its purchases and alluded to the uncomfortably large size of its holdings.

""It is necessary to have discussions pre-emptively to improve flexibility and nurture the market,"" said Ms. Masai, who used to work at a commercial bank.

A former  Bank of Japan  executive director,  Shigeki Kushida , said in a recent column in a publication for financial analysts that the BOJ could offer to sell its stocks to individual investors through financial firms rather than dumping the ETFs on the open market.

He said that method could avoid market confusion and encourage households to shift their savings into riskier assets from safe but zero-return bank accounts.",9,716,japan stock playing central bank rack billion gain,one japan biggest stock investor reported record gain billion well timed bet person engineered windfall getting wall street style bonus holiday season even started saying play market much hot hitting portfolio manager gov haruhiko kuroda head japan central bank mr kuroda led bank japan push unusual among global central bank tokyo stock market way rousing nation animal spirit march doubled boj annual ceiling purchase exchange traded fund equivalent billion month stock market began surging pandemic induced dip closed thursday year high year low superb timing helped central bank report record jump six month period stock portfolio gain released semiannual financial report thursday said market value holding stood equivalent nearly billion sept represented unrealized profit billion paid six month earlier boj barely unrealized profit left one point march mr kuroda said carrying large loss stock buying program began mr kuroda predecessor decade ago aftermath global financial crisis aimed making trading profit supposed encourage broader risk taking economy ensure price rising small steady clip recently inflation stuck around zero analyst questioning whether program much good especially pandemic factor weighing psychology consumer business also central bank owns total value tokyo stock market leading wonder whether premier symbol capitalism could undermined state influence nli research institute strategist shingo ide said central bank outsize role could hurt corporate governance act like shareholder monitoring company strategy ceo performance large unrealized profit mean bank holding also getting bigger bigger likely demand outside boj sell stock start thinking exit policy said naomi muguruma economist mitsubishi ufj morgan stanley security m muguruma said boj would feel comfortable starting discussion sitting profit central bank directly buy individual stock invests swath market exchange traded fund etf bought billion etf march alone pace slowed significantly recent month market recovers mr kuroda said last week thinking quick change program stock market one bright sign economy halfway back pandemic bottom need prevent market instability causing worsening business household confidence mr kuroda told parliamentary committee boj etf purchase effective easing instability caused impact coronavirus infection still sign rethink early stage one bank nine policy board member takako masai said last week bank might consider tweaking purchase alluded uncomfortably large size holding necessary discussion pre emptively improve flexibility nurture market said m masai used work commercial bank former bank japan executive director shigeki kushida said recent column publication financial analyst boj could offer sell stock individual investor financial firm rather dumping etf open market said method could avoid market confusion encourage household shift riskier asset safe zero return bank account

0,k1z1f5,"DOW, S&amp;P 500 on Track to End Week Near Record Highs","U.S. stock futures edged up Friday, signaling that markets will end the week on an upbeat note with major indexes near all-time highs.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.3% ahead of a short trading session, with markets scheduled to close at  1 p.m. ET . The blue- chips index earlier this week breached the 30000 milestone for the first time in its history, before sliding down on Wednesday. Trading was suspended Thursday for the  Thanksgiving  holiday.

Contracts linked to the  S&amp;P  500 rose 0.3%, suggesting that the broad-market gauge may erase its tepid loss from Wednesday. The index had climbed to a record Tuesday.

Major technology stocks, in particular, are poised to extend a rally that sent the Nasdaq Composite to its 44th record closing level of 2020 on Wednesday. Futures linked to the Nasdaq-100 index advanced 0.4% Friday.

Markets have been buoyant this week despite rising coronavirus infection levels across the U.S. and economic data pointing to a halting recovery that may curb consumer confidence. Investors appear to be looking ahead to next year, betting that Covid-19 vaccines will curb the pandemic and allow social and business activity to return to normal.

""The hopefuls are leading the realists: they believe that the economy will return to an equilibrium with a high growth rate. They are looking beyond the shock,"" said  Sebastien Galy , a macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management. "" It's a matter of time though: there are still deep underlying issues with Covid spiking in the U.S.""

The number of people hospitalized in the U.S. due to coronavirus surpassed 90,000 for the first time. More than 110,000 new cases were reported around the nation Thursday, sharply lower than totals in recent days. But infection levels are likely to rise again because of large gatherings and reunions for the  Thanksgiving Day  celebrations.

""There's still a lot of cases and restrictions in the U.S.: a lot of activity is going to stall again,"" said  Samy Chaar , chief economist at Lombard Odier. ""This will have an impact potentially on the next job market report,"" he said, referring to labor-market figures for November that will be released on  Dec. 4 .

President Trump said Thursday that he would leave the  White House  if the electoral college backs  Joe Biden , further helping alleviate concerns about investors about political uncertainty in coming weeks. The president's campaign has lost several legal challenges that allege election fraud, and he has come under pressure from Republicans to accept the results.

""He lost big enough for this election to be very difficult to contest. It's a done deal for markets,"" said Mr. Chaar. ""Everyone is working under the assumption that it will be a Biden administration.""

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 0.860%, from 0.878% on Wednesday. The U.S. government-bond market was closed Thursday.

In commodities, copper rose over 2% on expectations that demand from  China  will increase and due to a recent fall in global inventories.

Meanwhile, Black Friday kicks off the traditional start of the crucial holiday shopping season in the U.S. Investors will be closely watching metrics such as e-commerce and mobility data to try to gauge consumer confidence and the extent that the pandemic and historically-high levels of unemployment will weigh on the retail sector.

""Given the difficult year for so many retailers, there's definitely going to be expectations for them to try to play catch up,"" said  Esty Dwek , head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Solutions. Black Friday ""should give a nice bump to the \[economic data\] numbers.""

Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.1%. The  U.K.  was the worst-performing stock market in  Europe  Friday, with the benchmark FTSE 100 index sliding 0.8%.

Talks between British and European Union negotiators on a trade deal continue, with both sides having just weeks, at best, to reach an agreement. The  U.K.  government also announced new restrictions on Thursday to stem the spread of the virus as infection levels remain elevated, with  England  split into tiers that determine the scope of limitations on activity.

""The uncertainty around Brexit and the tiers system that is slightly tougher, that is outweighing any vaccine optimism,"" said  Michael Hewson , a chief markets analyst at  CMC Markets .

In  Asia , most major stock benchmarks gained by the close of trading. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.1% and  Hong Kong's  Hang Seng Index added 0.3% .

I am a noob investor trying to get into the field of value investing. I started my investing journey this June as I gained some cash as a joining bonus.

0,k1ltlp,"With Slack, Salesforce Would Put Heat on Microsoft","Salesforce Inc.  has thrived for years as a niche business-software vendor with a chief executive,  Marc Benioff , who has positioned himself as a prominent voice in American business.

Now Mr. Benioff is taking steps that analysts say aim higher, intensifying the company's battle with the industry's biggest player:  Microsoft Corp. 

Salesforce is in advanced talks to acquire  Slack Technologies Inc. ,  The Wall Street Journal  reported Wednesday, in what would be Mr. Benioff's biggest acquisition to date and the company's most direct attack on a market  Microsoft  has identified as critical to its growth.

The deal, which could still fall through, would add fuel to Salesforce's ambition to become the go-to software platform for business customers to use for everything from data analysis to managing customer relationships to even daily communication.

The pandemic has amplified Salesforce's efforts. When Covid-19 broke out, Mr. Benioff quickly launched [w]( -- a suite of applications companies could use for contract tracing, mental-health checks and shift scheduling.

A deal for Slack could heat up the simmering rivalry between Salesforce and  Microsoft . About five years ago  Microsoft  was in talks to buy Salesforce, but the deal fell apart over price. Salesforce lost out to  Microsoft  in 2016 in bidding for  LinkedIn Corp. , the business-focused social-media network. The loss stung. Salesforce responded by urging regulators to examine  Microsoft's  proposed purchase on antitrust grounds; the deal passed regulatory scrutiny.

Landing Slack, which  Microsoft  once tried to acquire, could amount to a bit of revenge for Mr. Benioff.

Having failed to capture Slack,  Microsoft  launched its own workplace collaboration tool, called Teams, spurring a sometimes heated battle between the two companies.

""They want to kill us,"" Slack CEO  Stewart Butterfield  told the Journal earlier this year. This summer, Slack filed a complaint with the  European Union  over alleged antitrust behavior by  Microsoft  in using its dominance to push Teams.

Slack ""extends the footprint of what Salesforce goes after,"" said Jefferies analyst  Brent Thill . ""Not everyone uses a sales system, but everyone can use collaboration. The beauty of Slack and Teams is that it touches everything inside enterprises.""

Mr. Benioff has a history of deal making since he co-founded Salesforce 21 years ago and turned it into one of the most successful companies in the then still nascent market of providing software as a service. Salesforce completed its biggest-ever purchase last year, paying around  $15 billion  in stock for data-analytics platform  Tableau Software Inc. 

A year earlier it splashed out more than  $5 billion  for cloud-application provider MuleSoft. Inc. This year Salesforce said it was buying cloud-software provider  Vlocity Inc. 

Mr. Benioff has long been one of  Silicon Valley's  highest-profile and most outspoken executives, using venues like the  World Economic Forum  in  Davos, Switzerland , to champion causes. He set up Salesforce with a pledge of corporate giving and bought himself an even larger platform with his acquisition of  Time Magazine  two years ago.

The  San Francisco -based company also has made a big push into the emerging field of artificial intelligence, developing tools to help customers make better use of their data. In 2016, it acquired PredictionIO, which makes software for building machine-learning apps. That followed the purchase of MinHash and Tempo AI, two further machine-learning companies. In 2014, it bought RelateIQ, which also specializes in the field.

Breaking into the market of workplace collaboration has long been on Salesforce's agenda. In 2010, it launched Chatter, a private social network for companies to collaborate. And in 2016, it bought cloud-document collaboration app company  Quip Inc.  for more than  $500 million . Neither product attracted a wide following. Acquiring Slack, which Salesforce had previously explored buying, would immediately make the company a big player in the workplace- collaboration market. Slack has more than 130,000 paying customers.

Salesforce, which declined to comment for this article, is pursuing Slack as competition in its core business of customer relationship management software is intensifying.  Adobe Inc.  this month said it would buy Workfront, a platform for marketers, for  $1.5 billion .  Microsoft  also has been pushing its rival product, called Dynamics. Salesforce still has the largest share with 20.1% of the world-wide market in 2019 compared with 2.6% for Microsoft Dynamics, according to research firm  Gartner Inc. 

Even with Slack, Salesforce would be a comparatively small rival to  Microsoft . The  Redmond, Wash. , company had sales of  $143 billion  in its latest financial year, generated by business enterprise software, its cloud-computing infrastructure, and consumer-facing businesses, such as videogaming, which has exploded during the pandemic. Its sales are roughly nine times Salesforce's annual revenue.  Microsoft's  market valuation tops  $1.6 trillion , about six times that of Slack and Salesforce combined.

Last year Salesforce said it was seeking to reach  $28 billion  in annual sales in the 2023 financial year. It had  $16 billion  in sales in its most recent financial year.

""He really needs to keep growing,"" said  Mark Moerdler , senior research analyst at  Bernstein Research , of Mr. Benioff. ""He needs another big acquisition. Slack gives him a big acquisition. It gives him revenue.""

Slack also has been looking to broaden its appeal. Companies have used Slack principally for intra-office communications. In June, the software provider introduced Slack Connect, which allows messages to be sent between different companies. Slack's Mr. Butterfield said the feature has driven a rise in paying customers and should fuel future growth.

But big acquisition plans aren't without pitfalls. When Salesforce tried to buy social-media company  Twitter Inc.  in 2016, Mr. Benioff faced significant pushback from investors and he walked away from the deal. Although Slack is more in the mainstream of Salesforce's business than Twitter, it would still come at a hefty price given Slack's  $17 billion  market value before Wednesday's stock surge.

TLDR: EV Battery Maker based in Texas, business focuses in Asia (China market is $$). One of the best EV battery techs right now. Already has 100M revenue this year.

It makes EV batteries based on Lithium Titanium Oxide (LTO) chemistry. Microvast's batteries have longer life, shorter charging times, and offer substantial lower cost of ownership by eliminating swapping station infrastructures required by buses running on LFP batteries.

Their batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, it expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year. Most other EV companies don't even have revenue yet.

* Georgia Runoff election (Jan 5): If the Democrats don't win that Senate race, are we still as bullish about Chargepoint?

0,k0qn1k,"Uber, Lyft, Doordash Can Pay Gig Workers Up To 15% Compensation in Stock Under New SEC proposal","&amp;#x200B;

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced a new proposal on Tuesday, which could allow companies like Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) and LYFT Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT), and DoorDash to compensate gig economy workers in equity.

What Happened: The regulator has proposed a pilot program for tech aggregators that hire gig economy workers or drivers, under which the companies can pay up to 15% of the worker compensation (not exceeding $75,000 in three years) in stock rather than cash.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton clarified the rationale behind the proposal by saying work relationships have evolved along with technology, and gig economy workers are a vital cog in the broader U.S. economy's growth.

The proposal will be open to a 60-day public comment period and may come into force only under the new leadership chosen by President-elect Joe Biden.

Why It Matters: California attorney general had sued both Uber and Lyft earlier this year for not following the California Assembly Bill 5, which forced aggregators to reclassify workers as employees, making them entitled to similar benefits. However, the ride-hailing companies won the Proposition 22 referendum that exempts it from reclassifying gig workers. 

In a bid to garner support for the referendum, the companies had guaranteed other benefits such as health insurance for drivers who work 15 hours or more a week, occupational-accident insurance coverage, and 30 cents for every mile driven, among other protections.",17,213,uber lyft doordash pay gig worker compensation stock new sec proposal,amp x b security exchange commission announced new proposal tuesday could allow company like uber technology inc nyse uber lyft inc nasdaq lyft doordash compensate gig economy worker equity happened regulator proposed pilot program tech aggregator hire gig economy worker driver company pay worker compensation exceeding three year stock rather cash sec chairman jay clayton clarified rationale behind proposal saying work relationship evolved along technology gig economy worker vital cog broader u economy growth proposal open day public comment period may come force new leadership chosen president elect joe biden matter california attorney general sued uber lyft earlier year following california assembly bill forced aggregator reclassify worker employee making entitled similar benefit however ride hailing company proposition referendum exempts reclassifying gig worker bid garner support referendum company guaranteed benefit health insurance driver work hour week occupational accident insurance coverage cent every mile driven among protection

0,k19efy,WHY to exit a position vs. WHEN to exit a position.,"**EDIT:** YES, I am aware that I would have lost out a ton if I had exited early out of TSLA, AMD, AAPL, etc..etc..etc.. This is true. I'd also like to say that I've lost a significant amount by not jumping out of these companies. Greed is a dangerous thing. That said, I realize that the missing element for me was having multiple portfolios. If you split cash up into YOLO-Aggressive, Aggressive and Retirement, then you'll have the mental space to work different strategies and risk options into your portfolio. 

**EDIT 2:** Compounding is your friend, but can also be your enemy with losses. 

**EDIT 3:** If you look at my post history you can see that my options calls anticipated a much higher return than 20% - those were strategies listed for my Ultra Aggressive portfolio. I still invested in them in my lower-risk portfolio, but had different exit points, and different investments (longer-term calls and stocks vs. short-term OTM calls). 

&amp;#x200B;

The question isn't \*when\* you should get out, its **why** you should get out.

Remember, the goal isn't 1 10x gain (though that's pretty amazing, right?!). The number of companies that see a 10x gain are &lt; 1%. However, if you get out at say a 80% gain, you're looking at a significantly larger chance of that happening. If you're looking at a 20% gain then, many companies can give you that return.

**Understand what your end goal is and break it down on how you can get there. Run toward that dream instead of running away from whatever it is that you think money will help you escape from.**

So what's all this mean? Figure out where you're trying to get to. Want to turn 10,000 into 1,000,000?

You could hope for 1 stock that you're fully invested in generating a 100x (1000% return). Chances of that happening... minimal. Chances of that 10,000 turning into 15,000 (50%) return much better. Look, making 1,000,000 out of 10,000 is NOT easy. It's luck, timing, and to an extent skill and discipline.

If you want to make a million bucks out of a single win on a 10,000 investment, you need to find something that's going to generate a 10,000% return. Good freaking luck. But... do you think you could find opportunities that can generate a 20% return? Probably so. Yes, you'll need to do this 500 times, but if you don't think you have the time and discipline to to find 500 opportunities in 700 days (2 trading years)... I mean... take a step back and breathe... Of course 10,000% is possible - you'll see that in WSB all the time. But what you won't see are the other two types of people:

1. People who made that 10,000% return over several years. Guarantee you this group is larger than that # of people who generated a single 10,000% return on 1 investment.
2. People who lost it all chasing that 10,000% return who have no interest in sharing their pain for BS karma points.  Guarantee you that this group is significantly larger than group 1.

&amp;#x200B;

**To put this all in perspective: Do you think you'd have an easier time of generating:**

\- 1 10,000% return or

\- 500 20% returns.

Put another way, do you think you could generate 1 20% return each day for the next couple years? It's not easy at all. But then again, if that's not very easy, then exactly how easy is generating 1, 10,000% return. And what happens if you lose your 10,000 on 1 investment that went south (cough...SPX weekly puts / calls)

**BEGINNING INVESTMENT:** $10,000

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:** $1,000,000

|\# of positive investment outcomes|% return required|Chances of this happening|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|10,000%|Really freaking low|
|10|1,000%|Really, really low|
|20|500%|still really low|
|50|200%|you've had a few of these I bet|
|100|100%|MSFT hands these out in the long run|
|200|50%|doable|
|500|20%|Really, really doable|

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: A note about compounding.**

If you consistently re-invested your gains, you'd only need 25 successful outcomes. This is doable, but it's incredibly risky as you're assuming (much like I did above) that every investment leads to a 20% gain. If you were to put all your eggs into one basket then this is what compounding *looks* like.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: A note about reality**

You're not going to consistently make 20% gains each investment. Some will be -5%, -25%, - 100% and others will be 5%, 20%, 100%, 400%. There are entire books, companies, funds etc...dedicated to figuring out how / when / who to invest in. I'm not going there. My point is not what you should invest in, but a reality check that turning 10,000 into a million is absolutely doable. If you go in knowing what it takes to get there, then you'll know **why** you need to sell a position (hint: so you can go on an re-invest that sum into another investment that is undervalued and hasn't yet returned what it's capable of returning)

0,k1fhvp,Questions about Interpretation of Key Ratios in Value Investing,"Recently, I have read a book related to value investment (Good Stocks Cheap). In the book, it is mentioned that some numbers are essential in determining the company's past performance and the current quality. However, I have found that some of the ratios are difficult, if not impossible to interpret due to the negative output.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, in many start-ups the operating cash flow and free cashflow can be negative. In this way, how to interpret the following ratios?

&amp;#x200B;

* Growth in Operating Income per Fully Diluted Share

&amp;#x200B;

§ ΔOI/FDS = 

&amp;#x200B;

\[(operating income / fully diluted shares)second\_year

\-(operating income / fully diluted shares)first\_year\] 

&amp;#x200B;

/ (operating income / fully diluted shares)first\_year

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Growth in Free Cash Flow per Fully Diluted Share

&amp;#x200B;

§ ΔFCF/FDS =\[(levered free cash flow / fully diluted shares)second\_year

\-(levered free cash flow / fully diluted shares)first\_year\]

&amp;#x200B;

 / (levered free cash flow / fully diluted shares)first\_year

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This cases can be as follows:

	1) The denominator is -ve, resulting in an -ve output

	2) The numerator is -ve, resulting in an -ve output

	3) Both the denominator and numerator are -ve, resulting in an +ve output

&amp;#x200B;

How should we deal with these situations?

0,k0wett,APXT: Merging with AvePoint,"APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.

APXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.

'AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'

Addressable market: $33 billion by 2022. 

The company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022. 

**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**

Management: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC. 

Big name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs, 

Big advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.

This seems similar to the other data related plays we've had this year \*cough\* PLTR \*cough\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.

The SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.

0,k17zoo,What am I missing here with MET?,"Looking at Metlife, as of today it has an earnings per share of $6.12 and a price of $47.76, so a P/E of about 8.

Compared to the maybe outdated Ben Graham rule of price/earnings over 15 being expensive, a P/E of 8 seems like a bargain, unless I'm missing something important about the company or global insurance markets. 

To my understanding, Metlife got out of retail life insurance awhile ago to focus on corporate products, and they have an established global brand.  

So what's the downside keeping the price so low?

The earnings return over time would be 6.12/47.76 = 13%, assuming they can just maintain their past performance, which to me doesn't seem unlikely. 

And there's also a 3.78% dividend, at a pretty sustainable payout ratio of 29.41%.

Palantir is an analytic infrastructure to companies, they are invaluable to companies that hold a big amount of data but has no plan or way to actually structure that data. I believe once you start using Palantirs products it's very hard to quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The product**

In order for Palantir to sell their product they literally have to get their FDE ([]( onsight. 

A lot of people have no idea what the hell Palantir does. They don't have a massive database where you just can pick out data from and spy on people. What they do is extract the companies data from different sources, structured and unstructured. Clean it and run it through various ML models in order to make sense of it. What they are actually are doing is building these huge interconnected pipelines between all the datapoints, things that had no connection before suddenly do. This is MASSIVE for companies, they can ask the right questions now. The have the answers infront of them, they just have to ask for it.

**The issue**

My whole problem with Palantir is that they are heavily dependent on this process, they can't just sell a product and one the same day have it working. They actually have to process the data for a few weeks before they have a working product, this is basically consulting. It's not scalable, it's customizable. They need units on the ground all the time for new contracts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now from my understanding it's actually improving, they are quicker and quicker with integrating new customers but I just can't see how they will scale as fast as people think they will. I don't think they can grow at an amazing pace.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

0,k1lmzt,How Three TikTok Stars Beat Back U.S. Plans to Ban the App,"In early September, a handful of TikTok stars, most of them in their early 20s, gathered on a Zoom call to tackle a weighty question: Should they take on the U.S. government?

After more discussions,  Doug Marland , a 23-year-old comedian from  New Jersey , raised his hand to join a lawsuit objecting to the Trump administration's order to ban the app. Two others -- musician  Alec Chambers  and fashion designer Cosette Rinab -- also volunteered.

The three have a combined 7.4 million followers on TikTok and make their livings off the app. The suit argued that a ban would mean losing their income and limiting their ability to express themselves.

The lawsuit got little attention when it was filed in a  Pennsylvania  court. The TikTok stars ultimately prevailed -- and the case has become central in creating a path for the app to maintain its foothold in the U.S., where it is now used by almost one in three Americans.

It looked like a grass-roots effort, but it was not. Behind the scenes, the legal action was orchestrated by TikTok and its Chinese parent company,  ByteDance Ltd. , according to people familiar with the matter. It lined up the influencers to be plaintiffs, connected them with a top First Amendment lawyer and helped create a legal strategy that was complementary to a separate lawsuit the company pursued under its own name, the people said.

It was an unexpected twist in a geopolitical business saga that began this summer, and continues with a preliminary deal still under negotiation that involves  Oracle Corp.  and  Walmart Inc.  taking stakes in TikTok.

ByteDance and its potential U.S. partners are optimistic about completing a deal in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with their discussions and internal thinking. On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted ByteDance a one-week extension to complete a deal, putting the new deadline at  Dec. 4 .

In August, President Trump signed an order calling for TikTok to be shut down or, alternatively, sold to a U.S. company. The administration said it feared ByteDance could share information about U.S. users with the Chinese government, which the company said it would never do.

The first ruling in TikTok's favor came with its own lawsuit, which argued that an initial  Commerce Department  ban on downloading or updating the app would harm the company's business. On  Sept. 27 , Judge  Carl Nichols  in the  U.S. District Court  in  Washington, D.C. , determined that the government likely overstepped its authority under national-security law. The government appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing.

On  Oct. 30 , Judge  Wendy Beetlestone , in federal court for the  Eastern District  of  Pennsylvania , ruled on the influencer lawsuit. She blocked  Commerce Department  restrictions that would have barred U.S. companies from listing TikTok in their app stores -- a move that would effectively make it inoperable in the U.S.

""Without access to the TikTok app, Plaintiffs would lose access to all of these followers, as well as to the professional opportunities afforded by TikTok,"" Judge Beetlestone said in her decision.

The U.S. government has appealed the ruling. The government called the plaintiffs' claims meritless and argued their request to block the ban would "" necessarily infringe on the President's authority to block business-to-business economic transactions with a foreign entity in the midst of a declared national- security emergency.""

In a statement, TikTok's interim head,  Vanessa Pappas  said: ""We stand behind our community as they share their voices, and we are committed to providing a home for them to do so.""

 One  of ByteDance's goals in recent months was to draw out the Trump administration's assault, the people said, betting that key officials would likely become increasingly distracted as the election approached.

The TikTok review by the administration began with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which evaluates deals for national security risks. That committee has ordered ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations of TikTok, out of concern that user data could be shared with the Chinese government given regulations there that require companies to hand over huge swaths of information. ByteDance has said it would never share data with the Chinese government, though analysts and experts say companies generally have little choice but to comply if asked.

ByteDance's legal efforts were designed to chip away at the more punitive efforts by the Trump administration, even while it pursued a deal that would satisfy the Cfius order, which also has bipartisan support in  Washington . Any deal will ultimately require signoff from the U.S. president.

Although President-elect Biden has not made clear his position on TikTok, the committee's divestiture order would still likely stand under new administration.

For now, an outright ban of TikTok appears off the table: On  Nov. 12 , the  Commerce Department  said it wouldn't enforce the order that would have effectively forced TikTok to shut down, citing the ruling in the stars' lawsuit, and the administration's legal options are dwindling.

""It's a big muddle because of these lawsuits,"" said a senior administration official.

Ms. Rinab, a 21-year-old senior at the  University of Southern California , said she started crying when she learned of the court victory. ""I was so, so happy,"" she said.

""This entire experience has been one I'll never forget,"" said Mr. Marland. ""It taught me a lot about the country, the way laws work, and court procedures.""

While TikTok was aggressively pushing back on the proposed bans in the courts, it also pledged to work cooperatively with national-security regulators on the potential deal that would address the U.S. government's data-security concerns.

In mid-September, the company announced it had chosen  Oracle  as its partner to secure its data in the U.S., with the software giant and  Walmart Inc.  taking ownership stakes in a new company that would run TikTok's U.S. operations.

A key sticking point that still needs to be ironed out is the size of the ownership stakes for ByteDance and its new U.S. investors, according to people familiar with the discussions and internal thinking.

The negotiations have already helped  Walmart  forge closer ties to TikTok, something that has motivated the retailer from the beginning, according to people familiar with the situation.  Walmart  is working toward partnering with TikTok on providing warehouse and shipment support for sales made through the app, and  Walmart  CEO  Doug McMillon  now has relationships with TikTok's executive leadership, some of the people said.

Executives at  Oracle , who see TikTok as a major customer for its cloud business, expect the deal to be completed before the end of the year, a person close to the company said.

ByteDance kept its lawsuits against the U.S. government active in part to ensure that the app didn't face a shutdown as the negotiations took place.

Mr. Trump would still prefer to get rid of TikTok in the U.S. altogether, though his attention has shifted to other matters, the senior administration official said. The official said that even though Mr. Trump gave his preliminary approval to a deal, he has never been fully sold on the idea because he doesn't want a transaction that could be perceived as benefiting  China .

Inside the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin , Attorney General  William Barr  and  White House  economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  have all said in meetings at times that they believe a deal could work, while  White House  adviser and  China  hawk  Peter Navarro  has advised Mr. Trump to avoid a deal, according to the senior administration official.

TikTok believes it will still likely need to divest its American operations or face persistent questions about its handling of U.S. data, according to people familiar with the matter.

A deal must ultimately get signoff from the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment and Mr. Trump, as well as the Chinese government.

The lawsuit was designed in part to put a human face on TikTok. Mr. Chambers, the musician, joined the app in late 2018, and a cover version of Halsey's ""Without Me"" recorded in the basement studio at his parents' house earned him thousands of early followers.

Now more than two million users follow his videos, many of which feature his own original music or his covers of radio hits. The 25-year-old from  Connecticut  has earned endorsement deals to promote Extra gum and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.

""TikTok has allowed regular kids like me, who don't have access to a lot of money or connections to people who are high up in the industry, to make a stamp in the music business,"" he said. ""I felt like I needed to fight"" for TikTok.

Mr. Marland, the comedian, said he likewise amassed enough TikTok followers to quit his job waiting tables and drop out of school. He now supports himself with sponsorships from brands including Snickers and Reebok, and boasts three million followers.

As threats against the app grew through the summer, TikTok officials stayed in close touch with top performers on the app to reassure them that they had a plan to ensure survival and to dissuade them from switching to rival platforms, according to people familiar with the outreach. As part of those communications, the company stressed that the stars had rights of their own to defend, the people said.

In September, TikTok brought the high performers together to talk on a Zoom call about the U.S. government threats and what might be done about them. They answered questions about how TikTok had affected their lives, according to a person who attended the call. Eventually Mr. Chambers, Mr. Marland and Ms. Rinab volunteered to be plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",12,1628,three tiktok star beat back u plan ban app,early september handful tiktok star early gathered

0,k1chqh,"Question from a rookie, what do you guys think will happen to Tesla next month?","I have around 7k USD in Tesla right now, which is basically all my savings, and as you all know it's been going up a lot since the announcement that they would be added to the S&amp;P list.

Yesterday I figured that this growth would probably continue for the rest of December, since they still need to actually be added to the list. So I thought it would be a good idea to open up a loan with my bank for about 3k and invest it into Tesla. Because you know, leverage!

I believed this could play out in 2 ways.

1. Either Tesla goes up a bunch in the next month and I can pay back my loan with basically 0% interest and let the rest of my profit sit in Tesla.
2. Tesla doesn't go up immediately, or maybe even dip down a bit, and I just let my loan sit there. I have 18 months to pay it back and if I do that then it'll cost me 200 USD interest. But I feel relatively confident that in those 18 months I'll have made more than 200 USD from rising Tesla stock.

But this morning when I woke up I thought, hmmm, what if the stock actually plummets when they get added to the S&amp;P list, because maybe that's the exact moment that a lot of people will think it's the best time to sell their Tesla stock to make some money. I'm a bit scared of that scenario. Even though maybe I have nothing to be afraid of if I just let my money sit there for the full 18 months.

I wonder what the experienced investors in this subreddit find the most likely scenario. Do you think it will keep going up when Tesla actually gets added to the S&amp;P list?

0,k0wau3,Market Impact from Capital Gains Tax Increases,"While the new administration has been clear that the [40% capital gains tax only applies to households in excess of $1M earnings annually](, it strikes me that this might have a negative impact on the market which many are unaware of entirely.

The Long-Term Capital Gains provides investors an incentive for staying in the market longer (&gt;1yr) and investing in a company's future, rather than focusing purely on short term gains due to being taxed higher. The equitable increase to a federal income tax for those high earners would seem to accomplish the following:

* Potentially reduce cap gains income for the government because those in the market will want to wait until the tax is reduced to realize their gains
* De-incentivize new investments because of the tax burden if they need to exit the market when taxes are so high

Is there any precedent for this in the past? What might those high-earning households look to as alternative investment vehicles, if anything?

The only counter I can see to this is that with the fed rate as low as it is, stocks are really the only way to realize gains in the current market so there may not be other options.

0,k0ue1o,Help me analyze Kraft Heinz (KHC),"KHC came across my radar this week and I'm curious to get some opinions. 

Dividend yield is currently at around 5% annual. Non-GAAP PE is at 11.52 (but GAAP EPS is negative for the last year). Hit the bottom at 19.99 back in March and is up 50% since then at around 33. Earnings have been beating estimates, dividend has been consistently paid out, and the numbers in general seem to mostly be trending in the right direction. I like that it is a decidedly old school, non-tech company to provide some balance with the tech heavy indexes. I would not expect huge growth moving forward, but the dividend yield means that matters a bit less. 

From reading up on the history, it seems that they were caught by a combination of misplaying the trend towards less processed foods while being spread too thin (yes, I went there) across too many brands and products. Berkshire then stepped in at the worst time thinking they were getting a classic Buffett value play and then basically ran them into the ground with things like Kraft Heinz merger and attempts to cut costs. 2019 was a particularly ugly year with losses, a dividend cut, and an SEC probe into accounting practices. 

That prompted a C-suite reboot and reassessment in strategy and things seem to be looking up since. It seems that many are writing that off as COVID related as people are buying more food for at home. There is certainly some truth to that, but clearly COVID is not going away soon unless the vaccine roll out is absolutely flawless, and even post-COVID, I feel this year's performance has given them the opportunity to reestablish themselves in a way that should carry forward.

0,k0xqsw,Guns &amp; Weed,"Americans loaded up on guns in response to the pandemic. It doesn’t take a genius to predict a similar spike in response to Biden winning the election. The bulk of this sale spike may not have even materialized since many of the biggest gun buyers still expect Trump to stay in power, and also because discretionary spending has been impaired without a second round of stimulus and persistent unemployment. Another round of stimulus checks and a full concession by Trump will spur unprecedented gun sales. The market leaders, Smith &amp; Wesson (SWBI) and Ruger (RGR), are my picks because reasons but it doesn’t really matter since it’s an industry play. 

For the longer term, will Biden have the political ability, or time, to take on the gun industry? Probably not. He will piss people off whether he takes a strong stance on guns or not, but with Trump gearing up for a 2024 run, Biden has more to lose politically by pissing off gun loving conservatives than progressives who will vote for him in 2024 no matter what.

0,k13obb,Why Square Stock Jumped 5% - Motley Fool,"Square has been a hot stock in recent months.  The 317x trailing earnings is a fair point.  Would love to hear opinions on why this guy is right and why he is wrong.  

Rich Smith (TMFDitty)
Nov 25, 2020 at 2:40PM
What happened
Shares of Square (NYSE:SQ) stock surged 4.9% in Wednesday afternoon trading, as of 1:40 p.m. EST, after the company announced it has reached a ""definitive agreement"" to acquire the Credit Karma Tax unit of consumer credit report provider Credit Karma.

So what
Square will acquire the free tax-filing service and add it to its own Cash App subsidiary in a deal valued at $50 million, cash. In a statement, Square explained that its new acquisition ""will expand Cash App's diverse ecosystem of financial tools -- which currently includes peer-to-peer payments, Cash Card, direct deposit, as well as fractional investing ... giving customers another way to manage their finances from their pocket.""  

In so doing, Square will also clear the way for Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to proceed with its own planned acquisition of the rest of Credit Karma. The U.S. Department of Justice had been holding up this latter acquisition, telling Intuit it could acquire Credit Karma, but only if the latter first divested its tax-filing business.  

Now what
This is good news for both companies. But is it good enough news to justify investors valuing Square at roughly $3.7 billion more in market capitalization today than the stock was worth yesterday? All because of a $50 million acquisition to the business?

I don't think so. And with Square stock now valued at a staggering 317 times trailing earnings, I think I'd be more inclined to use today's share price spike as an opportunity to exit Square stock than to buy any more.

0,k0xvyz,Index funds buying Tesla,"Hi community!

Have been thinking about this for some time now. Thought r/investing might also be interested to brainstorm with me on this. I try to keep it short and simple.

\- So current thesis is, that as Tesla will be included in SP500 in December, the price of stock will keep on rising from the buying pressure of index funds that must include the stock.

\- Back in September, decision not to include Tesla, caused more than 30% sell off (although there were other reasons for more than 30% retracement, such as market wide sell-off etc.).

Now lets make few assumptions and **please not let argue about those**, because i would rather love to see some theories on the subject i am about to propose. The assumptions are as follows:

\- Tesla stock price is in a bubble.

\- Decision committee that decides on inclusion, is not stupid.

\- Fund managers + committee and other parties involved talk to each other, are not stupid either.

\- Before mainstream and retail is informed, fund managers get the information somewhat earlier (lets please not argue about the legal aspects of this assumption).

Now what i am thinking, funds would like to avoid buying an asset with inflated value and would prefer to have as low entry point as possible. Now i am thinking, if i was party involved in either the decision making of inclusion and/or fund manager, what would my game plan be in October and at the start of November. 

So what i came up with as my best guess. My best game strategy would be to in this instance to purchase significant amount of \~monthly call options around the strike price of $500, knowing that once the information is made public, those call options would bring in a very nice profit and would help to significantly lower my entry price. Now somewhere around now, as price keeps steadily increasing, i would buy montly put options with a strike price around $400. And in a week or two, once i have enough, as pre accepted strategy with committee, i would make a public statement about ""some ongoing research into SP inclusion and therefore until further notice, Tesla will not be included"". Share price would plummet significantly and i would again make a nice 10x for example, on my put options. Now with the profits from both calls and those calls further invested into puts, i have more than enough profits, to now either purchase directly or exercise the options to have far more reasonable entry price for the stock. In a small cap entry, i would not even think (much) about such theory, but Tesla is currently just about to take worlds 9th place by market cap and its weight and effect on funds and SP500 is significant. Tin foil hat off.

So community, what do you think about my strategy/thesis as a theoretical commitee/fund manager member and what are your thoughts about commitee and fund managers going through October and November, knowing very well, that if by doing anything by the rules, they would need to buy into very inflated asset and overall, inclusion decision at current time would not be the smartest decision. Do you think they even care or need to care on these matters? Maybe they wont and that would make my whole point invalid.

I would be very interested in your thoughts on this matter. And please again, lets try not discuss and argue about those 4 assumptions i made above. 

Many thanks in advance!",4,580,index fund buying tesla,hi community thinking time thought r might also interested brainstorm try keep short simple current thesis tesla included sp december price stock keep rising buying pressure index fund must include stock back september decision include tesla caused sell although reason retracement market wide sell etc let make assumption please let argue would rather love see theory subject propose assumption follows tesla stock price bubble decision committee decides inclusion stupid fund manager committee party involved talk stupid either mainstream retail informed fund manager get information somewhat earlier let please argue legal aspect assumption thinking fund would like avoid buying asset inflated value would prefer low entry point possible thinking party involved either decision making inclusion fund manager would game plan october start november came best guess best game strategy would instance purchase significant amount monthly call option around strike price knowing information made public call option would bring nice profit would help significantly lower entry price somewhere around price keep steadily increasing would buy montly put option strike price around week two enough pre accepted strategy committee would make public statement ongoing research sp inclusion therefore notice tesla included share price would plummet significantly would make nice x example put option profit call call invested put enough profit either purchase directly exercise option far reasonable entry price stock small cap entry would even think much theory tesla currently take world th place market cap weight effect fund sp significant tin foil hat community think strategy thesis theoretical commitee fund manager member thought commitee fund manager going october november knowing well anything rule would need buy inflated asset overall inclusion decision current time would smartest decision think even care need care matter maybe wont would make whole point invalid would interested thought matter please let try discus argue assumption made many thanks advance

0,k05hnj,Analysis of the Key Distruptors in the EV &amp; Automotive Industry,"Hello all,

I decided I would do a comparable analysis of some major names in the EV industry to make sense of the current hype and growth estimates - and no, I will not be including Chargepoint or Workhorse. Given that the EV sector is still in a growth phase, I decided not to use price multiples and instead focused on performance, liquidity, how the street has treated it, how management has treated it, their supply chain and geographic exposure. Here is what I found.

---

#**[1-Year CAGR](**


Given the growth phase most of these companies are going through - and the impact of the coronavirus - a 1 year time frame for their CAGR seemed appropriate. Within CAGR I look at some very important fundamentals - Sales, EBIT (Operating Income), Net Income, and Free Cash Flow. Of the Chinese EV companies, Nio is the only one capable of generating net positive CAGR as you can see Xpeng and Li Auto drastically falling behind the rest of the pack. Nio even outperformed its North American competitors, General Motors and Tesla. I chose these two as comps because they are both the biggest competitors internationally against the up and coming Chinese EV companies, and have the potential to even dominate a share of China's EV market should the government allow it. I did not include Nikola in this as they are a pathetic scam in my opinion, but also because all of their numbers were so incredibly negative that it was completely skewing the data sets. So overall here is the ranking of these companies when compared against each other and the average:

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. General Motors ($GM)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

#**[Analyst Coverage](**

Analyst coverage is a very important factor for the majority of investors. Often times upgrades and downgrades can drive stocks for the month and can even act as the fire that lights up the volume of it. There is an expectation that analysts know what they are talking about but do keep in mind there is often a ton of outside influences on their decisions, such as the investment of their firm and political influences. Look more into how Enron extorted brokers for a 100% buy rating. 

Anyways, we see a lot of holds obviously as these companies have very rocky financials for the most part. Tesla and General Motors, having been in the spotlight for much longer and in a grander way, have the highest amount of buy ratings. There is only 1 sell rating across the entire data set and that comes from Tesla, which is expected due to the controversy of its growth and I will not consider it a threat. General Motors has a signifigant amount of Hold ratings due to their volatile past and overall historical decline which they are just now compensating for with a break into the EV market. This is likely to shift bullish in the future as the stock has seen growth as of late. The Chinese stocks are lacking in coverage as they are just now getting the attention of investors internationally, however they all have a significant amount of buy ratings and their coverage is far more positive than their American counterparts on a % of ratings basis. For that, I will rank them higher than Tesla or GM. 

1. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
2. Li Auto ($LI)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[YTD Performance](**

These companies are the hottest investments on the market right now, flat out crushing the indices and reaping in rewards for investors. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a huge factor in these companies and the idea that each of them can be the next industry leader. So far we are seeing each company get an equal share of the hype - driven up or down by their ability to meet the obligations of the market. (ie,. crushing earnings and meeting demand for delivery). NIO has ran laps around the rest of its peers as it was the first to receive such attention and came from the lowest of prices, having plunged to $2 a share in what feels like centuries ago. General Motors has moved the weakest as it is a value play that has been in the game for decades and has other segments it relies upon for growth. Xpeng's massive 40% move today pushed it above Li Auto and has it catching up to Tesla. Whether or not that happens, only time will tell.

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[Short Float](**

This sector has enough of the market betting against it to make any value investor go pale. However it has not stopped the companies at all, and the bears have been ripped to shreds as seen in the YTD performance. Li Auto has the highest short float at 15% as it is the youngest and smallest of the Chinese EV trio and is still relatively new. Investors often hear about Xpeng or Nio first before they find out about Li Auto so it does not attract the same hype as its counterparts, leaving investors to value it more heavily on its fundamentals which are gutter trash as it is still in its growth stage. The social media war between Elon Musk and his short sellers has seen the short float drop drastically from the double digits to where it currently sits at just over 6%. This is likely to go down in the future as it has been validated in its addition to the S&amp;P 500, showing to investors that it is no longer the shitty growth stock they used to bully it for. General Motors on the other hand has little to no short sellers as it is still in the ""old boys club"" of stocks. The street favors it much more highly given its massive track record and mega market cap. As these companies gain more in share price and attention, they will most likely get caught in the cross-hairs of sell side analysts more often. 

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Nio Inc ($NIO)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
5. Li Auto ($LI)

---

#**[Margins](**

Margins are one of the best ways to value a company's operation capabilities, regardless of whether or not it has positive cashflows. In the automotive industry, operating margins are a very important number but often fall flat due to the capital intensity of the industry. Companies such as the ones listed will often have highly negative margins as they are still finding solid ground for their balance sheets and are focused on delivering on their promises to customers and developing a pipeline of sales. 

With that in mind, we need to currently focus on which is the shiniest of the turds as every Chinese EV stock currently has crippling negative operating margins. Despite previous remarks, Li Auto has been shown to have the upper hand on Nio and Xpeng, with a significantly higher gross margin as well as less negative operating and net profit margins. Xpeng has a lot of catching up to do as it has nearly a negative 130% operating margin. General Motors and Tesla still come out on top as they have dealt with these financial issues long long ago. 

1. Tesla ($TSLA)
2. General Motors ($GM)
3. Li Auto ($LI)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

#**[Liquidity Multiples](**

Liquidity multiples are not something used often other than Current Ratio, which is the most important of the three in my opinion. The Current Ratio tells you how many times over a company can pay off its current debt with the value of its current assets. The Quick Ratio is what tells you if a company can pay off its current liabilities with its current liquid assets. The Cash Ratio is a spin off of this in which the current liquid assets are replaced with merely cash and cash eqiuvalents. It is far more restrictive and pins the company for a lack of cash on hand which is not exactly fair given the current stage of these companies. 

Anyways, Li Auto has the highest of these margins by a longshot. This is most likely due to its smaller size as companies just starting out will have less assets and liabilities and will show incredibly volatile multiples. Once it achieves a higher valuation this will taper off and most likely join its Chinese counterparts. Tesla and General Motors have the smallest of these ratios as they have much bigger balance sheets and expanded operations. Xpeng and Nio are second best to them as they are just now beginning to enter a valuation phase where it is harder to maintain such a high ratio like Li Autod does. The industry overall has very good ratios however which is a surprise given the financial state it is in. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[Leverage](**

Financial leverage expands upon the liquidity ratios I mentioned above by comparing assets and capital to the debt. I chose the total amount of each fundamental to accomodate for the difference in growth and size beteen General Motors, Tesla, and the up and coming Chinese EVs, which have much more near-term obligations as they are still growing. 

Nio automatically raises a red flag as its Total Debt / Total Equity is in fact negative, and by a significant amount which implies it has negative shareholders eqiuty. In a realistic world, this would imply Nio is on the brink of being dissolved and that there is a massive liquidity draught from investors fleeing ship. The company has been successful thus far despite this because of how incredibly cheap debt is, and Nio is swimming in it. Should interest rates rise in China or the US, this could destroy the company in the short-term. However with Yellen being brought back into the fight, it is highly unlikely US interest rates will go anywhere anytime soon. 

General Motors has the highest Debt/Equity as it has been on the rocks financially for a while now and has a lot of issues to get through on its massive balance sheet. This is the equivalent to a senior citizen being bound to a wheelchair. Whether or not it can compete with the young and tough Tesla is dependant on their current investment strategy in EV, and if Nikola is anything to go by, I don't think they stand much of a chance unless they get more competant management.

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. General Motors and Nio have tied as they are both equally dog shit in this regard 

---

#**[Institutional Ownership](**

This helps signify if the street is putting its money where its mouth is, and also shows us where that particular mouth is.  Li Auto has seen investor activity quadruple as funds and ETFs have quickly added it to their holdings. This is set to taper off as it grows and solidifies itself amongst its peers. Meanwhile, funds cannot find the door fast enough as they run far the hell away from General Motors, with 54% selling off as of late. My guess is that the Nikola screw up made the boomers spit out their coffee during the live stream and realized GM's EV potential is dead in the water until further notice. Tesla's lack of institutional ownership can be attributed to funds 1) taking profit, or 2) selling off as TSLA no longer qualifies for their fund and finally 3) Institutions shifting their assets into other EV stocks as Tesla is no longer the only signifigant eqiuty in the basket and there is room for more growth oppurtunity in smaller companies like Nio, which has seen a neat 43% raise in institutional ownership. Funds are getting their feet wet and slowly adjusting to having a position in the Chinese EV market. The Chinese EV market is in fact dominating and Xpeng and Li Auto have both soared as well, due to the recent spike in confidence that the trade war with the US will end under Biden and that renewable energy is the future of China. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

#**[Geographic Exposure (As % of Revenue)](**

Geographic revenue is pretty rigid right now as the Chinese stocks are landlocked in China. Whether or not Tesla dominates the market in China is everyone's concern right now and when you see that the operating leases of Li, Xpeng and Nio are primarily financed through CCP subsidiaries, you realize China has no interest in foriegn invasion of market share. Tesla may gain some footing, but I think the market will primarily be contested between the three stocks that call it home as they are being funded similar to the US funding the space race with Nasa and Boeing. The 0.4% other is from a supposed revenue stream coming from Macau, of all places. Not sure what to make of that. General Motors has the most diverse revenue geography with 13% of revenue coming from places outside of Asia and the US. Given their signifigance in the broader automotive and industrial industry, this is to be expected. Tesla has focused primarily on the US during its massive growth phase and the incentives raised by those such as California who made it much more attractive to own their products. They are slowly breaking into Hong Kong and Mainland China but are waiting on more interest from the government entities, and as I said above that is not likely going to turn out in their favor enough for it to move markets. Overall I will be ranking them on their diversity of geography.

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Tie for third between the Chinese EVs - Nio, Li, and Xpeng Motors

- - -

And last but not least...

#**[Supply Chain Analysis](**

The supply chain is critical to any corporate infrastructure. A weak link can break the whole chain and having a higher amount of suppliers and customers means less risk if one of them fails to accomodate. 

Given the developments the Chinese EVs are still going through - and considering their funding by government subsidiaries - private and public contractors are not too present in their supply chains. Nio, hower, has 31 suppliers and 7 partners it sources from. This would often be a good indicator, however with the previous liquidity and margin ratios it tells us that they have a huge cash problem if they are losing so much money despite such a signifigant backbone of a supply chain. Verticle integration is certainly out of the picture for Nio anytime soon as they cannot even stand when supported by others. It is currently a free rider and being pushed to its current value by these partners and suppliers - not that this will stop any time soon. Given that they are just now rolling out production, it shows them having 0 customers. Disregard this.

Given the massive networking conglomerate that is GM, they have 441 suppliers and 39 customers - those 39 customers probably being worth trillions in combined market cap. I grabbed these numbers from FactSet as my bloomberg terminal is close to 200 miles away. If you have access to one though and are curious, run the SPLC function on GM and see what you get. 

1. General Motors ($GM) 
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

Do what you will with these numbers and factoids. How you weigh each factor and the ranking of the companies is up to you. Li Auto and General Motors tied for first as they are both the biggest and smallest companies in the basket. NIO is second place and overall I would consider it to be the most level headed choice as it is not too big or too small, not too volatile or too stagnant among other things. I personally have shares in NIO as of $31 and don't regret it, however I don't look to expand my exposure to the sector anytime soon as I'm currently tied up in other investments.

0,k0bma7,Ford stock is climbing,"Ford is currently at 9.42 today, from 8-something yesterday, if memory serves. I used to work as a contractor at GM, and between the two, I definitely have more trust in Ford to be a stable investment. Part of my faith in Ford comes from the fact that they worked themselves out of debt without the help of the federal government, unlike GM. Another reason is because, during my time working as a contractor, I noticed that the entirety of GM management that I came across seemed to believe that the trucks they were producing essentially rendered their Cameros, Corvettes and other luxury vehicles nearly obsolete in the market, because the trucks offered all the luxury features and the added utility that a big vehicle naturally brings. 

For reasons I couldn't quite grasp, they continued to produce vehicles which they believed were undermined by one of their own products and which they didn't seem to have faith in, in terms of selling power. Ford, meanwhile, seems to have focused on trucks first and foremost, which, as GM seems to believe, have superior market potential for the aforementioned reasons. GM seems committed to production of luxury vehicles for reasons other than simple supply and demand motivations. I heard some say part of it was the tradition and the association between product and brand. I'm not sure, but the fact that I couldn't understand their rationale makes me skeptical of ever looking to them as a stable investment. Ford, from what I can tell, seems to understand their niche and their limitations and seems willing to operate within them, whereas GM seems to be banking the prestige of their vehicles making up for the lack of popular demand for them; maybe they think they are going to experience another Transformers.

I am not an expert on either company, these are just my two cents. But my gut is telling me that Ford is worth it, both because of its low price and its seeming stability.",4,332,ford stock climbing,ford currently today something yesterday memory serf used work contractor gm two definitely trust ford stable part faith ford come fact worked debt without help federal government unlike gm another reason time working contractor noticed entirety gm management came across seemed believe truck producing essentially rendered cameros corvette luxury vehicle nearly obsolete market truck offered luxury feature added utility big vehicle naturally brings reason quite grasp continued produce vehicle believed undermined one product seem faith term selling power ford meanwhile seems focused truck first foremost gm seems believe superior market potential aforementioned reason gm seems committed production luxury vehicle reason simple supply demand motivation heard say part tradition association product brand sure fact understand rationale make skeptical ever looking stable ford tell seems understand niche limitation seems willing operate within whereas gm seems banking prestige vehicle making lack popular demand maybe think going experience another transformer expert either company two cent gut telling ford worth low price seeming stability

Day traders have terrible track records. 

Academics who study stock pickers have long observed that the vast majority of professional money managers – about 85% – underperform their benchmarks over a multiyear period.

Now those professionals are turning their sights on retail day traders, warning that the same poor results apply to them as well. 

 “I don’t confuse day traders with serious investors,” Princeton professor Burton Malkiel, author of “A Random Walk Down Wall Street,” wrote in a blog for Wealthfront, where he is chief investment officer.  “Serious investing involves broad diversification, rebalancing, active tax management, avoiding market timing, staying the course, and the use of investment instruments such as ETFs, with rock bottom fees.  Don’t be misled with false claims of easy profits from day trading.”",9,137,attention robinhood power user day trader lose money,attention robinhood power user day trader lose money cnbc com day trader terrible track record academic study stock picker long observed vast majority professional money manager underperform benchmark multiyear period professional turning sight retail day trader warning poor result apply well confuse day trader serious investor princeton professor burton malkiel author random walk wall street wrote blog wealthfront chief officer serious involves broad diversification rebalancing active tax management avoiding market timing staying course use instrument etf rock bottom fee misled false claim easy profit day trading
0,k07nkd,Carbon credit investment,"Hi everyone

What does the community think about investment in carbon credits? 

In the coming period, as governments crackdown on greenhouse gas production, they will need companies to be net carbon neutral. As the companies strive to reduce the carbon production, they will have a period of needing to purchase carbon credits to offset the current levels of production.

In this realm lays the carbon credits. To offset the current levels of games produced, they buy carbon credits.

Now I'm not sure how consumers/traders can invest in carbon credits. There is one ETF that i found KRBN which allows such.

Does anyone have any ideas regarding such an investment or other ways to invest in carbon credits? Also whether one should even pursue investing in carbon credits?

Any thoughts would be appreciated!",3,127,carbon credit,hi everyone community think carbon credit coming period government crackdown greenhouse gas production need company net carbon neutral company strive reduce carbon production period needing purchase carbon credit offset current level production realm lay carbon credit offset current level game produced buy carbon credit sure consumer trader carbon credit one etf found krbn allows anyone idea regarding way carbon credit also whether one even pursue carbon credit thought would appreciated
0,k0p8ah,What is the point of non 100/0 long-term portfolios?,"For example, why would somebody interested in long-term investing want a portfolio made up of 80% stock and 20% bonds. I usually hear people talk about bonds as a means to help protect against the huge swings of the stock market and as a pool of capital to invest in the stock market when it goes down and people want to buy stocks ""on sale"".

If you have a long-term portfolio, why would you care about big swings early in the portfolio's lifetime? While I understand having bonds ready to invest in the stock market whenever it dips, I'm curious about how much rebalancing a manager would do within an XX/YY account. Will they sell the bonds and buy stocks when the market dips, or are they too constrained by the ratios defining the account?

Additional, tangentially related question: I've also heard of people using bonds as a relatively liquid asset in the event of needing cash while your stocks are down. In this case, it sounds like an extra emergency fund.

0,k0iur3,The industry that might flourish again - Nuclear Power,"I have not done much due diligence here but the first 2 hours of research gave me an impression that Nuclear Power might be a new game in town. How? (this topic mostly focuses in the US) 

**1)** Climate change, a carbon-free world has been pushing us towards investing in renewable energy for the past few years mostly solar and wind but the investment in those has not been great and coal produced energy has been mostly replaced by natural gas which emits 50-60% CO2 than coal but still not zero. So the solution is if you want complete carbon-free is nuclear. But Americans we have a problem with that. Since the end of 1990s , not a single nuclear plant been built in the USA because we are scared of it. Chernobyl, 1970s "" The China syndrome"" movie (btw, imo, the most powerful movie probably in the world that was able to kill the whole industry) etc. 

2) things might change, Joe Biden has a plan. and not the little plan but 2 Trillion $ plan! Joe Biden is interested in nuclear power (also in solar and wind, but I believe those are quite inefficient vs nuclear and does not create high paying jobs as Joe says)   especially in SMRs (small Module Reactors) - which are less risky , more efficient to build- does not require &gt;8-10 years to construct like current nuclear power plants. (meaning less CAPEX, fast ROE)

If we need to live up to Paris Climate accord and build carbon free world, it seems nuclear power is the way. Currenly, US's 50% renewable energy is coming from nuclear which is also 20% of total electricity generated - making the US biggest nuclear energy generator. However , compared to France for instance, nuclear stands for more than 80% of electricity. 

So, the question is who might benefit if Biden goes nuclear (pun intended). Unfortunately, there are not many public companies focused on SMRs . One I could find was NuScale which is private. But it is majority owned by Fluor Corporation (publicly traded) and what I found online that they might have a contract with BWX Technologies (major customer is Sovereign - submarine, navy). Anyways, I could write down here for pages but tried to keep short.

0,k0ab4e,$ESI Element Solutions DD," 

Hello  everyone, just wanna give you the heads up that I am fairly new to  this. I make my own DD before investing in a company but I have no way  to know if my DD is good until after the fact. So, I had this idea of  posting it here and the community can discuss the ticker and my DD. I am  hoping that I you guys can pick-up on any mistakes that I am not aware  of.

All the data was collected from MarketWatch, SeekingAlpha and YahooFinance.

So, Element Solutions (**$ESI**)  is a specialty chemicals production corporation formerly known as   Platform Specialty Products Corporation (changed the name in 2019). They  own several business brands: MacDermid, Compugraphics, Fernox, alpha  and Kester.

The company does business all over the world (EUA, South America, Europe, Asia) and has reach to a many key markets:

* Automotive
* Computing &amp; Telecom
* Consumer Goods
* Energy &amp; Resources
* Military, Aerospacial &amp; Medical
* Mobile &amp; Wearables
* Printed Packing
* Water Treatment

I won't go over them in detail, just a few key point:

**Automotive**

According to their website, their automotive initiative ESI:Automotive includes **EV/Powertrain**, **Safety systems (ADAS)**, Lightweight, Interior and Exterior.

Their EV/Powertrain business is directed at Battery management systems and inverter solutions.

The Safety systems (ADAS) include sensors, cameras, **Lidar**, central computer and conectivity.

The remaining divisions are mainly for improved materials, displays, touchscreens, etc.

Also according to them the ESI:automotive has **more than 1400 active patents**.

**Computing &amp; Telecom**

They throw a lot of big words around: Big data, AI, 5G... but **at the end of the day they supply the materials** to build and operate those systems. Which is fine.

""Specifically developed materials that are utilized in many of the  highest technology processors today.""

""High-performance assembly  materials and solders are the conduit of electronic functionality.""

**Consumer Goods**

As more to do with **aesthetic** and surface solutions, coatings, etc.

**Energy &amp; Resources**

They deal with oil companies and **solar** companies.

""The  offshore oil industry uses our control fluids to effectively and   safely recover oil from the deepest depths. The photovoltaics industry   utilizes our chemicals and materials to conduct new electrons as soon as   they are created within solar cells.""

**Military, Aerospacial &amp; Medical**

Coatings/shock  absorbers for airplanes, circuit metallization and high integrity  solders connections for military aplications, semiconductor packaging  methods for circuits in medical imaging devices and chemicals that form  the circuity of medical eletronics.

**Mobile &amp; Wearebles**

""Our printed electronics initiative is helping companies to explore the  **printed electronics market**  with our combined product and application  experience spanning circuit  metallization, assembly and soldering,  precision coated films, and  printed graphics. We represent a strong and  organized front in this new  and exciting industry, and are looking  forward to shaping its  development in the decades to come.""

Again they throw around big words like 5G, Cloud, streaming,  extended battery life, etc...

**Printed Packaging**

This area is all about printing those nice, vibrant and appealing packages that catch your eye at the supermarket.

""In the graphics packaging industry, we are a leader in innovation. With **global patents and trademarks**,  our research and development drives  flexographic printing forward.  Printers turn to us to ensure the  expectations and demands of brand  owners are met for every print job  they deliver.""

**Water treatment**

**Manufacture and supply of chemical and filter technology** to diagnose, treat  and protect domestic and commercial heating systems in **markets across  the globe**.

""Many  of our products are award winning and are accredited with  independent  approvals for their energy efficient and environmentally  friendly  credentials.""

All  in all, this seems like a company that has their fingers in a lot of  markets. Some are still growing (EV, Solar energy, semiconductors) and  other are more well established (Water treatment, printing packages,  Medical) which in my opinion gives them the oportunity to grow and have a  nice fail safe cushen if things go south.

**The numbers**

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|2018|2019|TTM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|1,96 B|1,84 B|1,78 B|
|Net Income|(81,5) M|78,9 M|121,2 M|
|EBITDA|411,5 M|400,5 M|390,4 M|

&amp;#x200B;

**Market Cap:** 3.34 B             //                              **Free Cash Flow (2019):** 100.7 M

**P/E:** 29.39

**EPS:** 0.48

All  in all, I like these numbers. There might be no substancial growth  going on right now, but as the company pointed out in their last  earnings, COVID took a tool on their clients, and business has not  increased as expected. Nontheless they managed to increase their Net  Income (TTM) and maintin a health EBITDA.

0,k0cn90,Question on SPAC's,"Hi everyone!

This is going to be my first post, I feel it's necessary because I'm in a bit of a tricky situation regarding the purchase of shares of a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company).

I've been bagholding shares of GMHI (Gores Metropolous Inc, the SPAC) for a while now. The proposed merger will bring Luminar (a private company pursuing to take a shot at a (large) piece of the global market share on LIDAR-technology for autonomous vehicles) public under a new Tickr 'LAZR'. 

My question is the following: The proposed merger has a fixed valuation before (attempting) to going public, and they are issuing shares to the public and keeping some shares private. To my knowledge, this would mean they have a fixed share price when the merger goes through (Approx. 10 USD/Share if I'm not mistaken).

However, the SPAC is trading +- 36% higher than this at the moment. The company has stated that all outstanding shares of GMHI will be turned into a 1:1 equivalent amount of shares for LAZR. **If the merger goes through, does this mean that when the original TICKR (GMHI) turns into LAZR, the value of the shares would possibly decrease to 10 USD/Share (even though I bought in at 12.5USD/Share of GMHI)?** 

Or does the market value of the GMHI shares carry over to the new TICKR? 

To me it's obviously important whether or not I should sell my shares pre-merger to buy in at a lower price point, or will market sentiment 'most likely' correct the new share price of LAZR?

Hope everyone is doing okay today. I've been watching markets for years and have definitely been in tune with 2020's various twists and turns for investors. I usually conduct several hours of research before even considering investing in a stock. My usual strategy involves sticking with businesses I understand and staying away from investments I feel are clearly overpriced.

In this market, I'm noticing that certain meme stocks are king. Plug Power, Tesla, Jumia Technologies, Nikola (previously), and others have run far away from a level where many investors are comfortable making a purchase. I've also noticed that the returns of several friends and family members are absolutely trouncing the rest of the market. These individuals often conduct less than one hour of research and barely know the P/E, P/S, or business model of the stock they are trading.

Are there risks in these markets? Have we shifted to a new paradigm where everybody should just buy TSLA, PLUG etc. and just coast to retirement in 5 years? If this can continue, surely you would think that pension funds would toss those 2% bonds in the garbage and buy such securities.

$9B, and it’s still not done???

That means the company has to be at least $180B in size, otherwise SECs 5% ownership rule would kick in(although it could receive special exemption).

Since BRK.B is not done yet, we can assume it’s a very big fish with a very large float, otherwise that stock could likely go vertical due to lack of supply of shares.

There are not many companies that fit this bill, which company could it be?

Some people are thinking it’s TSLA but I am kind of doubtful.

0,jzhwhf,The Tesla Bull Case in Brief,"**Disclaimer**

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&amp;#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](, so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&amp;#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

**Revenue**

|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008|15|\-|
|2009|112|646.67|
|2010|117|4.46|
|2011|204|74.36%|
|2012|413|102.45|
|2013|2,013|387.41|
|2014|3,198|58.87|
|2015|4,046|26.52|
|2016|7,000|73.01|
|2017|11,759|67.99|
|2018|21,461|82.51|
|2019|24,578|14.52|

[Source (Macro Trends)](

&amp;#x200B;

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&amp;#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&amp;#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](

&amp;#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY]( Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&amp;#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing]( this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&amp;#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&amp;#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&amp;#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Source (Hypercharts)](

&amp;#x200B;

[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).

[Source (Statista)](

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](;pkey=S1dbei4)

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as ""the internet of cars"".

&amp;#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&amp;#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](

&amp;#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&amp;#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

&amp;#x200B;

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&amp;#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|160,000|200,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a &gt; 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&amp;#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Disclosure**

While I have no financial position in $TSLA, I'm sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I'd expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting).",6,2145,tesla bull case brief,disclaimer financial position tesla point time interest

0,k04xe2,Investment choices intra/post COVID,"Hi everyone, I hope this post is OK to post here but just wanted to put my thoughts down in a thread and see if anyone can give their insight/opinion as to whether my thinking is as simple as this. I am aware many outcomes can come from the current climate, none of which can be predicted, but I am looking for your thoughts based on the next 18 months going as such:

(note: I am from the UK, but I think it applies similarly to US/EU investment too)

January 2021-June 2021: Vaccination of Elderly   
June 2021-Dec 2021: Vaccination of second/third ""at risk""   
Jan 2022-June 2022: Back to ""Normal"" (vaccinations required)

**At the moment** I see a couple investments as very attractive. Recovery stocks in the short term and Gold/Silver in the middle term. Long term is too far away for me to consider right now. My thinking is that recovery stocks (mostly travel related) are very underpriced right now. I'm up 10% just this week from them and most of them will have to increase by 300-500% to get back to pre-pandemic levels. My thinking is that once vaccination becomes a reality, all the pent up demand for airlines/cruises and the like will surge these stocks to (or given stocks can be hype-fuelled) or further than their pre-pandemic levels. I personally am pushing for many over 50s cruise lines as I expect them to be the first to re-open given the first phase of vaccination is of that demographic. I expect stocks to soar in travel in 2021, but would be intrigued to hear all your opinions on this. I also personally think property may be a good options mid 2021 in the UK as IR's will still be very low and the bubble will have popped by April 2021 (no explanation needed there lol)

Now, I think what's next? I read last week that UK banks are experiencing record high levels of savings. People aren't spending as much as they were. The problems with the travel industry is they have reduced capital, grounded so many planes and logistically it will be a nightmare to match even pre-pandemic demand. Their supply is going to be drastically cut shorter, but demand will be massively higher. I think people will justify paying more than they were used to out of desperation and their savings account balance justifying it. What does this do? Increases prices and surges inflation. This is good for the government as they don't have to increase taxes as much given the debt proportionately decreases and it's good for those companies as they can recover quicker. It's not good for the average person who has a savings account still at the 0.5% interest rate. Yes, eventually the gov will raise IR's when inflation becomes unstable, but until then, what do we do as investors? That's where I'm going to position into gold (and a bit of silver).. at LEAST until IR's come up. 

My strategy to conclude is as follows:

**Short Term:** Recovery stocks (very under-priced)  
**Short/Mid Term:** Property (IR Low / Prices Low)   
**Mid - Term:** Gold (Inflation)

0,jzouxt,Long Term Rental Apartment Fraud in China (DNK),"Original article in Chinese, translation by DeepL and OP.

With the rumors of bankruptcy of Danke Apartments(DNK) and continuous defaults by Ziroom Apartments, how long can Long Term Rental apartments survive?

I couldn't bear to read the rumors about Danke Apartments declaring bankruptcy and frequent defaults of Long Term Rental Apartments, so I decided to write another article.

It is true that for young people who are new to Tier-1 cities (Beijing, Shanghai, etc.), they cannot afford to pay rent on a quarterly or yearly basis. Long Term Rental apartments, which charge monthly fees and are simply furnished, are supposed to be a good business.

However, over the past few years, more than 60 Long Term Rental apartment companies have defaulted, and a variety of shortcomings have emerged, such as paying high prices acquiring apartments, renting them at low prices, then the executives flee to foreign countries with the money, defaulting on rent payments to landlords, giving tenants arbitrary price hikes, and charging high service fees .......

At present, among the remaining leading enterprises, such as Ziroom Apartments claims to have 500,000 landlords and 3 million customers, and Danke Apartments claims to have 400,000 rooms and has served 1 million customers. With such a huge number of properties and customers, why is it that suddenly the liquidity is strained and the company has been reported to be going out of business?

In fact, many readers are not aware of the financial model of Long Term Rental apartments.

The Financial Model of Long Term Rental Apartments

Whether it's a Danke apartment or another Long Term Rental apartment, they all have the same basic routine.

The first step is to find a landlord who will waive one month's rent to cover the renovations needed for a Long Term Rental.

The second step is to find a tenant to rent the apartment, and there are usually several options for monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual payments. The tenant will usually be asked to choose the monthly payment because it gives a certain cash bonus.

And therein lies the catch. If the tenant chooses to pay monthly, he or she must apply for a ""rent credit"" with a finance company. Long-term rental apartments will generally lure tenants into signing a one-year lease by reducing the rent by hundreds of yuan in various ways, so that the tenant can get a loan from the finance company for a total of 11 months' rent, which will be credited to the long-term rental apartment's account at once.

The tenant pays one month's rent up front, with a one-month security deposit, and then pays the rent once a month. Ostensibly, the tenant does not have to pay the interest on the rental loan and only has to pay the monthly rent according to the negotiated rent.

For example, if an apartment costs the landlord 3,000 yuan per month to rent, he rents it to the tenant for 3,600 yuan per month.

At the same time, the tenant pays an 8% management fee of $240 per month. In total, the long term tenant will receive $3,840/month.

In fact, the tenant is renting the apartment at an interest rate of 28%. This is also a disguised usury that raises the price of the rent.

The third step is that the tenant loan goes into the pocket of the Long Term Rental apartment in one lump sum, and they take this prepaid rent to continue renting, renovating the apartment, and running the company.

Their profitability lies in the difference in rent, as well as the difference in interest.

So if they are managing hundreds of thousands of apartments, why are they running out of money on their books?

There are two reasons for this.

The first one is that they expand like crazy. When they get a rental loan, they immediately jump into the market to grab another property. Once they get the property, they don't rent it out immediately, and they lose the free time in between.

These rent payments to landlords take up a lot of money.

The second is the cost of renovation. Usually when they get a house, they will renovate it first. If the cost of renovating one room is 50,000 yuan, the capital occupied by 400,000 rooms will be as high as 20 billion yuan.

This is an astronomical figure, so while the revenue of long-term rental apartments continues to grow, the amount of losses also continues to expand.

For example, in the first three quarters of 2017, 2018 and 2019, Danke Apartments suffered net losses of 272 million yuan (657 million in revenue), 1.370 billion yuan (2.675 billion in revenue) and 2.516 billion yuan (5.712 billion in revenue), respectively. In the past three years, the net loss exceeded 4 billion yuan.

In order to be profitable, long-term rental apartments must be able to continue to operate most of the renovated properties after recovering the costs of renovation.

In the event of a large-scale landlord surrender, or a tenant surrender, the Long Term Rental apartment's financial chain will break (they run out of capital).

This is because if the landlord surrenders the lease, the cost of renovation will not be amortized and will become a loss.

If the tenant surrenders the lease early, the Long Term Rental apartment needs to repay the loan and interest from financial institutions.

At present, the share of rental loans in the revenue of Danke Apartments and other long-term rental apartments is over 60%. 2019, the debt ratio of Danke Apartments apartments is over 100%.

In other words, the debt ratio of these long-term rental apartments has surpassed that of real estate developers, who are essentially dancing on financial leverage.

Since 2019, nearly 60 Long Term Rental apartments have gone bankrupt due to financial breakdowns and mismanagement. After the explosion of a number of parent-rental apartment institutions, many places in China also explicitly issued a letter to stop ""rent loans"".

In December 2019, the Opinions on Rectifying and Regulating the Housing Leasing Market Order were issued, which included rent and deposits into the regulatory accounts. The Opinions require that the rental income of housing rental enterprises shall not exceed 30% of the amount of housing rental loans, exceeding the proportion shall be adjusted in place by the end of 2022.

This means that all Long Term Rental apartments such as Danke Apartments and Ziroom Apartments must reduce their rental loan ratio, which also means that the loan funds they rely on for survival and expansion will be greatly reduced.

If there is no capital transfusion, the financial chain may break at any time. This is the main reason why so many Long Term Rental apartments have gone bankrupt.

Long Term Rental apartments are suitable for young people in big cities, but the innovation of this model has no technical content, and the main threshold is capital.

For example, the investors of Danke Apartments are Tiger Global Fund, Pleasure Capital, Kaiwu Investment, CMC Capital, and Chunhua Capital, which hold 20.0%, 15.7%, 10.4%, 9.4%, and 6.9% of the shares respectively, and Ant Financial also holds 7.8% of it's shares.

Those long-lease apartments without wealthy and generous investors are almost dead.

But no matter how good an investor is, it's hard to hold on for long when faced with a venture that continues to fail to see a profit.

The mandatory requirement of ""within 30% of the rental loan ratio"" will put an end to the wild growth of Long Term Rental apartments. It is necessary to think about how to make legitimate profits in business, not just to make a large scale, monopolize the number of houses, and then play the Internet game of harvesting after autumn.

Didi (Chinese Uber) ended up playing the monopoly, and failed to do the harvesting after becoming a monopoly. What's more, the long lease apartment is even heavier than Didi's model, dancing on the financial bubble.

Before the end of 2022, more and more Long Term Rental apartments will definitely go bankrupt and the executives would flee to foreign countries. Therefore, both landlords and tenants need to keep their eyes peeled, look carefully at the leasing contract and loan contract, and say no to all the overbearing clauses.

At the same time, in the trillion-yuan rental market, long-term rental apartments are a product needed by young people, but a better system is needed to regulate them, rather than letting them fall into this high-leverage financial game.

The status quo not only raises rents and the burden of renting for young people, but also adds a huge financial risk to society.

0,jyxfkr,"When Robinhood users pile into a stock , the average daily return is 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month"," [](

&amp;#x200B;

from buying the dip to surfing the tech surge with options, an investor following the Robinhood crowd this year would have a lot to feel good about.

Provided they didn’t follow too long, that is.

Users of the millennial-friendly app -- the first to offer commission-free trading -- are more likely to chase popular stocks with extreme performance. The result is herding that ultimately becomes a drag on those companies’ returns, according to the latest [academic research ]( retail investing.

 When Robinhood users pile into a stock in large numbers, the average excess return on the day surges to 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month, a new paper found. 

 

The thinking is that in seeking to make investing easier, the platform’s slimmed-down interface could be resulting in concentrated trading in the most “attention grabbing” shares. That increases the chance of herding which can lead to big market reversals.

“Robinhood users are more subject to attention biases,” wrote authors including behavioral finance pioneer Terrance Odean. “The combination of naïve investors and the simplification of information is associated with herding episodes.”

Robinhood was at the center of Wall Street drama this year as the young fintech firm stirred up an investing [frenzy]( amplified by Covid-19 restrictions and stimulus cash.

As retail volumes spiked, even professionals started tracking the activity of Robinhood’s 13 million users in a hunt for fresh trading signals. To do that they relied on data from Robintrack, a website that provided updates on retail stock demand, on which the academics also based their calculations.

One idea from the academic world: A strategy of selling a security after a herding event and buying it five days later delivers a 3.5% return and nearly double that for more extreme scenarios.

In fact, the researchers say there’s good reason to think hedge funds are doing some version of this, since they observed a spike in short interest among shares bought heavily by Robinhood traders.

[Read more: Robinhood Users Weren’t as Reckless as Portrayed During Rally](

It’s familiar territory for two of the paper’s co-authors. Odean at the University of California, Berkeley, and Brad M. Barber at the University of California, Davis have previously [documented]( a tendency for individual investors to buy stock darlings.

In the case of Robinhood, they argue it’s even more extreme, since many users are first-time investors on a platform that offers frictionless trading and only limited information. For instance, users buy equities on the app’s “Top Mover” list more aggressively than other individual investors, meaning they’re more likely to trade extreme losers as well as winners.

“How information is displayed can both help and hurt investors,” wrote the team, which also included Xing Huang at Washington University in St. Louis and Chris Schwarz at the University of California, Irvine. “The simplified user interface influences investors decision.”",28,468,robinhood user pile stock average daily return followed reversal nearly subsequent month,amp x b buying dip surfing tech surge option investor following robinhood crowd year would lot feel good provided follow long user millennial friendly app first offer commission free trading likely chase popular stock extreme performance result herding ultimately becomes drag company return according latest academic research retail robinhood user pile stock large number average excess return day surge followed reversal nearly subsequent month new paper found thinking seeking make easier platform slimmed interface could resulting concentrated trading attention grabbing share increase chance herding lead big market reversal robinhood user subject attention bias wrote author including behavioral finance pioneer terrance odean combination na investor simplification information associated herding episode robinhood center wall street drama year young fintech firm stirred frenzy amplified covid restriction stimulus cash retail volume spiked even professional started tracking activity robinhood million user hunt fresh trading signal relied data robintrack website provided update retail stock demand academic also based calculation one idea academic world strategy selling security herding event buying five day later delivers return nearly double extreme scenario fact researcher say good reason think hedge fund version since observed spike short interest among share bought heavily robinhood trader read robinhood user reckless portrayed rally familiar territory two paper co author odean university california berkeley brad barber university california davis previously documented tendency individual investor buy stock darling case robinhood argue even extreme since many user first time investor platform offer frictionless trading limited information instance user buy equity app top mover list aggressively individual investor meaning likely trade extreme loser well winner information displayed help hurt investor wrote team also included xing huang washington university st louis chris schwarz university california irvine simplified user interface influence investor decision

0,k05stp,Too many people investing in the stock market is doubly dangerous,"Just a shower thought, really. Not sure if this has been discussed before or not. Overall, I can see 2 major issues with people actively investing in the stock market and that the number of people doing so has increased (drastically?) this year.

1. Inflated prices. 
Okay everyone knows this. Too many people buying something that's limited in quantity will push it's price up. No biggie.

2. No real increase in disposable income.
This seems to be a really big problem. It's not like people have gotten richer or have a bigger pay check now. This means that people are saving money and investing that.

Why is that a concern?

Because if so many people are cutting down on expenses to invest the surplus, consumerism will go down. If people are putting off buying a new smartphone, a new car, make upgrades to their homes to save money and invest, it is going to hurt the associated business. A lot. Which means their earnings will go.

0,jzmjke,"IMAX is surging, will it maintain?","I suppose based on vaccine anticipations and the news that Wonderwoman 1984 will not be HBO Max exclusive, but also released theatrically. AMC is also surging today, no doubt for the same reasons. Will either maintain or will it just be another temporary bounce on their bumpy road?

The fact that they are sharing a release with HBO Max and that audiences may not be all that interested in the film itself, however well its predecessor failed, all seem like strong caveats. On the other hand, there is certainly going to be a strong segment of hardcore fans that will no doubt watch the film however they can and also a segment of people who have probably been chomping at the bits to get back to theaters. Whether or not these groups crossover sufficiently is one of the big questions, in my opinion. And while Wonderwoman was a hit, it was no Avengers: Infinity War, i.e., a mega-event which united and galvanized franchise fans.

I would have more confidence if I saw stronger marketing for the film and of course, if hope wasn't resting on a single movie. What gives me hope is the fact that people take dates to movies and Wonderwoman is, in many ways, a perfect ""compromise movie"" for many couples; it features action and superheroes, which would attract many men, and romance and themes of female empowerment which could bring in women (to speak in generalities).",6,238,imax surging maintain,suppose based vaccine anticipation news wonderwoman hbo max exclusive also released theatrically amc also surging today doubt reason either maintain another temporary bounce bumpy road fact sharing release hbo max audience may interested film however well predecessor failed seem like strong caveat hand certainly going strong segment hardcore fan doubt watch film however also segment people probably chomping bit get back theater whether group crossover sufficiently one big question opinion wonderwoman hit avenger infinity war e mega event united galvanized franchise fan would confidence saw stronger marketing film course hope resting single movie give hope fact people take date movie wonderwoman many way perfect compromise movie many couple feature action superheroes would attract many men romance theme female empowerment could bring woman speak generality

0,jyuc6r,Stocks vs. Real Estate,"Hi. It seems the most important benefit of investing in private real estate is the potential to use **leverage** to boost both capital appreciation and yield. Provided there is enough net yield to cover interest and mortgage payments, eventually, as you start paying off the debt, you could achieve a pretty strong return. Assuming a 2% growth rate in the capital value, with a 20% deposit you are leveraging at 5X. If you were to maintain this LTV ratio of 80%, you'd basically be getting 10% IRR excluding interest expenses/yield. Of course, if the yield increases or you can produce a net yield after interest, you are getting some uplift there too. It wouldn't be inconceivable to manage 20% IRR.

Stocks might net 5-7% per annum (without making any significant, optimistic assumptions). Using leverage with stocks is generally ill-advised as even 2X ""LTV"" could/would get you margin-called in a recessionary crash (e.g. Q1 2020).

So, I'm thinking, what important elements am I missing here? Excluding the geographical risk of the property, which is no doubt important to consider. But with enough properties (long term) you could achieve some degree of diversification (albeit not to the extent afforded by stock index funds).",4,199,stock v real estate,hi seems important benefit private real estate potential use leverage boost capital appreciation yield provided enough net yield cover interest mortgage payment eventually start paying debt could achieve pretty strong return assuming growth rate capital value deposit leveraging x maintain ltv ratio basically getting irr excluding interest expense yield course yield increase produce net yield interest getting uplift inconceivable manage irr stock might net per annum without making significant optimistic assumption using leverage stock generally ill advised even x ltv could would get margin called recessionary crash e g q thinking important element missing excluding geographical risk property doubt important consider enough property long term could achieve degree diversification albeit extent afforded stock index fund

0,jz574m,Using probability and Kelly Criterion for investment sizing,"I recently ran into the problem of deciding how to split money into different assets (more specifically stocks and bonds). The idea is that the investment size should be a function of the probabilities of receiving the cash flows, and the cash flows themselves. For a company this could be the future free cash flows, and for a bond it would be the future coupons.

My first attempt was assuming one would either lose all their money, or make a specific profit. I tried multiplying each expected profit with the probability of me getting it (implying that the probability of total loss is 1 - P(profit)), and then doing the same for all other investment opportunities. Consequently, I added all the terms, and each term divided by the total would give me its share of the total portfolio. But there were several problems with this approach:

1. It is too black and white. In reality there are multiple outcomes, not just profit and bankruptcy. If I have the probabilities of partial winnings and partial profits, I should be able to use this extra information for better approximations.

2. It is illogical for special cases. If I have an investment opportunity with a winning probability of 100% and cash flows higher than other opportunities, then my calculation would not tell me to put 100% of my money into it, which is obviously irrational because of the high profit and zero risk.

Later I stumbled upon the Kelly Criterion for bet sizing and tried applying it. Again, I faced the black and white problem, but then also the fact that I couldn't generalize it to more than one bet, because the Kelly Formula is meant for single bets. In the end I found some articles detailing solutions to my problems, but the math was way to complicated for me to comprehend.

If someone has a way of dealing with asset allocation in this manner, as a function of cash flows and probabilities, please comment below.

0,jyeh16,Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) - An in-depth Stock Analysis,"# Introduction:

Good morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll (on r/dividends), so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.

Anyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged?
4. Is there strong cash flow?

Let's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.

# JNJ - Johnson &amp; Johnson:

Johnson &amp; Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.

Johnson &amp; Johnson is the world’s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:

* pharmaceutical,
* medical devices and diagnostics,
* consumer good/discretionary

The pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:

* immunology,
* oncology,
* neurology,
* pulmonary,
* cardiology,
* metabolic diseases.

The device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women’s health.

**Strengths:**

&gt;\-  Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.

**Risks:**

&gt;\-  Litigation surrounding several J&amp;J products have the potential to blemish the company’s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  
&gt;  
&gt;(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)

# Financial History:

One thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|
|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|
|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|
|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|
|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|
|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|
|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|

Increases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.

So ...

1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes
2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes
3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.76%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|

Delicious.

# Final Thoughts:

From a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Furthermore, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.

There are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Additionally the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

It also impacts traditional card payment processors like a Stripe or Adyen.

0,jz6q0o,Are quick screeners like Gurufocus and Validea Reliable?,"I'm what, I guess, professional long term Investors would call ""lazy"" in that I used websites like Gurufocus, Fiviz, Stock Target Advisor, Zacks, Morning Star, ChartMill, etc to screen financals, or often go solely based off the ratings that the websites(excluding Finviz) give a stock. 

And also I use websites like ValueWalk, Screener, Gurufocus, Validea, etc to pick possible stock based off premade screeners built based off what investment Guru's look for.

But before dropping a bunch of cash, sitting and forgetting, I am curious if these websites are reliable and take the work out of manually looking at a stocks SEC documents every time they release financal information. To be more specific, are these website stocm ratings(Zack's ABC's, Gurufocus 1 to 10, ChartMill stars, etc) and guru screeners trustworthy or are they essentially useless, even with the strictest settings which I like to use(Everything has to have the highest score in everything).

And if they are extremely reliable/useful, are they reliable enough to render investment experts like Financal Advisord, Wealth Management Planners and Investment Consultants obsolete or, at the very least, too overpriced compared to what one could get from these websites?

If you're questioning if I'm using the sites correctly, allow me to explain my top picks. I've settled on investing in companies like WIT, MIXT and PRIM because they all have high marks on at least 3 of the websites I named above.

WIT was scores highly for financals and profitibilty on. Plus it was listed as a 3.5/5 for earnings preditability, a 0.97 for revenue preditability. It did lag in valuation, all according to Gurufocus. Plus on Zacks, mostly given high marks. And Ken Fisher, Cliff Assess and O'shaughnessy are shareholders.

MIXT also had very high scores for financals and profitibilty, it has a Predictable margin exp in Gurufocus, it ranked #2 using Zacks and Jim Simon's is a shareholder.

PRIM is rated high for financals, profitability and valuation (though it is a little lower for it's financal strength than I'd prefer). It also passed my screener on Finviz which requires every fundimental criteria to be acceptable (Past, present and future EPS Growth positive along with the Sales growth, ROE, ROI, ROA, Gross/Operating/Net-Profit Margin, and low Debt, Current/Quick Ratio). It is #1 for Zacks and has all A's on Zacks for Value/Growth/Momentum. And David Shaw, Cliff Asness and John Overdeck are shareholders.

I also have settled.on CODA, PLAB, HOLI, etc as they are runners up for being highly rated on at least 2 sites. KOZAY is an OTC stock which peaks my interest because of Gurufocus as it's the only OTC stock(with a good Beneish M-Score) under $30 with a near perfect score plus it has the highest overall score of all stocks under $30 where it's is an 8/10 for financal strength and a 9/10 for profitabilit and it's undervalued. 

HVT is the only stock on Validea that mostly qualifies as an investment opertunity with it being listed on at least 8 prebuilt Guru screeners.

0,jytjm5,How to structure a Step-down Kickout plan,"Before Covid, i remember seeing various kick out plans, they worked as follows:

1) You invest your capital of say 100k. If at the end of year 1, the index is greater than 105% of the FTSE 100's start date level, the plan matures and you get your capital back plus 8% return.

2) if the ftse is less than 105% a year later, it doesn't mature, and instead continues for another year. This time if the ftse is greater than 102.5% of its starting level, you get 116% return, otherwise it repeats for another year. Each year the reference level decreases, and you get an extra 8% on maturity. 

3)this goes on eventually until the policy finally kicks out, or else you it reaches the end of say 10 years, in which case you lose some of your capital.

From reading the brochures on them and Googling, i still can't decipher what sort of suite of investments and options would allow a provider to offer this type of structured product. It seems like you would want to be very unlucky for it to go the 10 years and not Kickout.

0,jyfcjm,HPQ short analysis,"I purchased HPQ at $20.61 the other day, and yep, it's dropped a little since then. I'm new to investing, but my thought process feels logical, and I fully plan to put more into this stock, and here are my thoughts.

I initially purchased positions because they are announcing their Q4 earnings on the 24th, and I believe they've done really well this last quarter with sales of laptops from everyone working from home, as well as prolonged lockdowns being announced and less opportunity to begin working in shared spaces. Those who didn't already have a work laptop, definitely do now. To me, HP screams student/business compared to Dell, and other competitors that give off more of a casual use appeal (like Chromebooks).

After purchasing, I stumbled across news that HP is supplying Shutterfly with 60 new digital presses that will use HP Software. I believe more than ever that Shutterfly has seen a boost in revenue because people are holding onto any good memory they can have during this pandemic. You better believe people have opted to print pictures of family members and display them around the home if they don't already, because of limited to no contact. 

Shutterfly also offers a photo album creation service that our family has personally used during Christmas two times now, with amazing results and memories that will last forever. The service is perfect during this pandemic.

It seems to me the stock is undervalued, based on the last few years. It hasn't had a problem staying above $21 up until the pandemic. Even from the pandemic dropping HPQ to $13, the stock recovered quickly back up to $20 as of November.

0,jy8rq8,Dropbox getting more popular. Opinions?,"What are your opinions In Dropbox? Since this summer I see more and more people on YouTube, Reddit and on other platforms that talk about Dropbox as If it is the next great tech darling. I like DBX and I think it will do well, but I doubt it will quadrouple in the next 5 years as some suggest.

Also, what is odd is the fact that 1) the pandemic did not propell this stock and 2) even though all these social media gurus talk about it and pump it, the stock fell which I believe is just short term impacience from traders and hype.

Here are my thoughts:

Talking valuations is has a sub 20 forward PE and recently started getting profitable. The market cap is just around 8b. Share price 19$.

Financials. It's short term assets cover is short and long term liabilities. No debt. And a future buyback program. Positive FCF.

Product. I use dropbox at work and at home with my family and I really like the fact that it's UI is easy to understand and use, when comparing it to OneDrive and GoogleDrive. So, user growth+ a nice product which is expanding into smart workspace, not just cloud storage. Also, they bought hellosign, which could be second to DocuSign in the digital signature space. 

When glancing who owns DBX shares, we can see really large funds like vanguard, black rock and the rennaisance group. Also insiders hold 30 percent of the company and they did not sell any shares recently. One co-founder is still actively with the company and is the CEO for 13 yrs. I love it when founders stay and fight for the company, it gives the company credibility.

Possible tailwinds: included into NASDAQ 100 and S&amp;P500. Smart workspace makes a big difference and people accelerate to it's products. Hellosign gets a DocuSign type valuation. A big fund actively promotes the company.

The risks: google or microsoft focus more on smart workspace and kill dbx product by underpricing. Extending into smart workspace fails and it kills their financials.
Pretty large shareholder dillution in the past. So that growth/dillution is not that great.
CEO and co-founder leaves the company
Meh expected revenue growth of 8.5% in the future.


Based on the fcf to equity discounting that many people use for the company, and a discount ratio of 8%, a growth ratio of 2.2%(5yr us bond), the share price should be around 23$ now. Price target 2025 40$.

0,jxryz3,WSJ: A Stock Market Bubble? It’s More Like a Fire,"I found today's Intelligent Investor column interesting - in regards to the recent surges in EV stocks, SPACs, etc.

[\_lead\_pos12](

 

The stock market isn’t a bubble, but parts of it are on fire.

So far in 2020, the NYSE FANG+ index of giant technology stocks is up 78%. The [Renaissance IPO ETF](, [IPO **1.45%** ]( exchange-traded fund that holds recent public offerings, is up 84%. The [SPDR S&amp;P Kensho Clean Power ETF](, [CNRG **+1.35%** ]( invests in renewable-energy companies, has gained 88%.

Meanwhile, the overall stock market is up almost 11%.

That’s a key difference.

For years, anyone who thinks any financial asset is somewhat overvalued has called it a bubble. The financial use of “bubble” [originated centuries ago ]( describe massive speculation that [inflates market prices to the bursting point](

Financial bubbles have never had a formal definition, though, and they are [diabolically difficult to identify]( without the benefit of hindsight. A new book, “Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles,” by finance scholars William Quinn and John Turner of Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, helps clarify the muddled thinking on the topic.

The image of a bubble is itself a misnomer. As any kid who’s ever chewed gum knows, bubbles often barely expand before bursting, and they don’t bother anybody much except parents and teachers.

Financial markets, however, can easily heat up fivefold or even 10-fold and then collapse at least 50% in a flash, burning millions of speculators and sometimes charring entire economies. Think of the U.S. after [the stock market crash of 1929](, or [Japan 60-plus years later](

Rather than regarding overvalued assets as a bubble, we might consider them a fire. The more it expands and the hotter it gets, the more havoc it can wreak.

“Boom and Bust” looks closely at 300 years’ worth of market manias using the metaphor of “[the fire triangle](” That image has long been evoked to explain the conditions necessary for flames to erupt and persist: oxygen, fuel and heat. Remove one, and you can prevent or put out a fire.

The oxygen of investing is marketability, or the ease of buying and selling an asset. Centuries ago, that meant carving up difficult-to-transfer corporate ownership into tradable shares. Nowadays it’s carrying a stockbroker in your pocket. With a smartphone-trading app, you can buy or sell so-called fractional shares in increments anyone can afford.

On popular trading apps like Robinhood, you can put as little as $1 in [Berkshire Hathaway]( Inc.’s Class A shares, which cost about $345,000 apiece. You can trade that morsel of approximately 0.000003 shares commission-free.

The second side of the fire triangle, fuel, is manifested in financial markets by money and credit. Low interest rates make investing with borrowed money cheaper, while paltry yields on safe savings compel people to invest in riskier alternatives.

Today, borrowed money fuels mega-billion-dollar private-equity firms buying entire companies—and individual investors conducting small “margin” trades with as little as $2,000 in a brokerage account.

The third side of the triangle, heat, is supplied by speculation. When prices go up, more people buy, inflaming prices even more and attracting another rush of speculators.

That lures in naive buyers who think making money is easy. But [hedge funds and other institutions]( also chase those hot returns, fanning the flames even higher.

The “Boom and Bust” book completes the metaphor by noting that the fire triangle has in recent years been [updated with a fourth component](, an “exothermic chain reaction.”

Marketability, credit and speculation are necessary, but not sufficient, to start and maintain a market fire. A fourth component, what the authors call a “spark,” is also needed.

That can come from new technology, government intervention or both. The stock-buying binge of the late 1990s was sparked by euphoria over the potential of the internet. China’s more-recent market booms have been stoked by government policies and propaganda.

“Boom and Bust” shows that most bubbles tend to be confined to a few stocks or industries.

That was true in 1824-25, when Latin American mining stocks listed in London rose more than fivefold in roughly six months, while British blue-chip companies lost almost a tenth of their market value. Again in London, in the 1890s, shares in bicycle companies more than doubled in a year even as major stocks went nowhere.

In 1999, with internet stocks going ga-ga, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 86%. Without [technology companies](, the S&amp;P 500 would have been up only 5%.

Today isn’t much different.

In proportion to market size—which weights giant tech stocks heavily—the companies in the S&amp;P 500 recently traded at 21 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Matarin Capital Management, an investment firm in New York. That’s about 24% higher than their average over the past quarter-century.

To counteract the effect of a handful of giant stocks, however, we can weight companies equally. In that light, the S&amp;P 500 is at about 17 times expected earnings, roughly 10% above its long-term average. That implies that most stocks aren’t cheap—but are hardly overstretched.

I don’t see much cause for concern about overheating in relatively small areas like newly listed stocks, alternative-energy firms and [shell companies formed to do buyouts](

The bigger worry is that a fire among a few giant stocks can set the neighborhood ablaze. After the technology-heavy Nasdaq index collapsed in 2000, the broader S&amp;P 500 also tumbled.

Recently, smaller companies and cheap “value” stocks have started to show signs of recovery—which, if it persists, could reduce the market weight of blazing-hot giants like [Amazon.com]( Inc.

Because this has been a contentious topic lately, here's a graph that shows the inverse P/E ratio (the rate of return) minus interest rates as well as the SPX level. 


Stocks get expensive when, relative to bonds, they are outside some return threshold. Seems to be around 1% or at most 2%, which is the difference between AAA-rated bonds and T-bill values.


I am almost certain that if you extend this back 100 years, you'll see the same concept: 

Stocks are expensive when they pass below a certain threshold here, say 1%, and cheap when they pass above 2% difference between stocks and bonds. 

As we look to 2021, earnings for many companies that had low covid earnings will rebound, while those that were beneficiaries may either benefit long term (in many tech cases) or compress to normal. 

I expect earnings to grow overall, giving more room to stocks to run, while interest rates stay low.

I believe that the main reason that investors don't beat the market is that popular analysis and investor sentiment regarding stock picking and investment strategy, while looking solid on the surface, is fatally flawed and leads to significant underperformance. Let me start with analysts.

Most companies on the market aren't worth investing in, yet stock market analysts are statistically more likely to give stocks a buy rating than a sell rating. This is because of the fee structure that many analyst-firms follow, with many companies pretty much paying analysts to give them a buy rating. Overall, analysts are focused on their reputation, if they rate a company as sell and they are wrong, not only will that company no longer give them their business, but their reputation is significantly damaged. To avoid this, they lie. This is bad on its own, but when combined with institutions who trust these ratings, it is a recipe for underperformance.

Many institutions trust analysts' biased ratings. They buy when a buy rating is shown, and they sell when a sell rating is shown. On top of trusting foolish ratings, most funds are hyper-focused on the short-term movements of a stock. Why do they do this? Because if the fund doesn't show immediate returns, their investors flee to another fund that is. This ultra-focus on short-term price movements is damaging. As Ben Graham said, *""In the short-run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine""*. Short-term movements of a stock's price are random and impossible to consistently predict. They are white noise, a product of whatever captivates the mind of the market at any one point in time. Long-term stock performance, on the other hand, is directly connected to the intrinsic value of a company and, when using proper analysis, is much more predictable.

Overall, it is in my opinion that the poorly incentivized analysts feed terrible ratings to the poorly run firms which in turn take these ratings at face value in their pursuit to try and make a quick buck in order to attract more investors to their fund and secure lucrative bonuses.",14,442,idea company buy large fail beat market,secret firm company fail beat stock market index fund lot theory mine believe main reason investor beat market popular analysis investor sentiment regarding stock picking strategy looking solid surface fatally flawed lead significant underperformance let start analyst secret wall street analyst heavily incentivized follow pack come stock recommendation wrong crowd nothing happens wrong stand alone lose job bother voicing opinion could cost career company market worth yet stock market analyst statistically likely give stock buy rating sell rating fee structure many analyst firm follow many company pretty much paying analyst give buy rating overall analyst focused reputation rate company sell wrong company longer give business reputation significantly damaged avoid lie bad combined institution trust rating recipe underperformance many institution trust analyst biased rating buy buy rating shown sell sell rating shown top trusting foolish rating fund hyper focused short term movement stock fund show immediate return investor flee another fund ultra focus short term price movement damaging ben graham said short run market voting machine long run weighing machine short term movement stock price random impossible consistently predict white noise product whatever captivates mind market one point time long term stock performance hand directly connected intrinsic value company using proper analysis much predictable overall opinion poorly incentivized analyst feed terrible rating poorly run firm turn take rating face value pursuit try make quick buck order attract investor fund secure lucrative bonus

Those programs that received Treasury collateral under the CARES Act will be coming to an end.

They include the primary and secondary market corporate credit facilities, under which the Fed purchased corporate bonds, as well as the Municipal Liquidity Facility for state and local governments, the Main Street program and Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility, aimed at keeping the market for those securities liquid.

* FirstSolar
* Tesla (some say they will compete against Sunrun)
* Plug (hydrogen plants)

0,jx3k9d,Billionaire Salinas Has 10% of ‘Liquid Portfolio’ in Bitcoin,"[](

Bitcoin has one of its wealthiest backers yet.

[Ricardo Salinas Pliego](, Mexico’s third-richest person, said in a Twitter post Tuesday he’s invested a chunk of his liquid assets in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.

“Many people ask me if I have bitcoins,” said Salinas, who has a $11.8 billion fortune through his stakes in retail, banking and broadcast businesses, according to the [Bloomberg Billionaires Index]( “YES. I have 10% of my liquid portfolio invested it.”

Bitcoin is nearing record highs after more than doubling this year, partly driven by fears that major central bank easing and fiscal stimulus will debase currencies. The digital asset [advanced]( for a third session Wednesday, outperforming most of its rivals to break above $18,000. Its performance has attracted some big Wall Street money managers including Fidelity Investments, which launched a Bitcoin fund over the summer, and macro investor [Paul Tudor Jones](

In a series of tweets Tuesday, hedge fund founder [Ray Dalio]( questioned the cryptocurrency’s utility as a storehold of wealth, but [added]( “I might be missing something about Bitcoin, so I’d love to be corrected.”

Other wealthy Bitcoin backers include Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who are [now]( worth about $1 billion each from the cryptocurrency’s surge, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.

Bitcoin’s gains have helped make up for Salinas’s business interests. Shares in his biggest listed asset -- conglomerate [Grupo Elektra SAB]( \-- have slumped more than 10% this year, while those in the local [television network]( he and his family control have dropped almost 60%.

A spokesman for Salinas didn’t immediately reply to an email and phone call seeking comment.

Salinas, 65, who contracted Covid-19 last month, [said]( in a later tweet he first invested in Bitcoin four years ago, adding he holds the balance of his liquid portfolio in precious metals miners. Salinas and his family have earned more than $500 million through dividends from their listed holdings in the past two decades, according to the Bloomberg’s wealth index.

Salinas has also used Twitter to comment on the pandemic. He previously called for Mexico’s health officials to stop imposing “[authoritarian](” policies to contain the spread of virus and took to the site again to reveal his own diagnosis.

“Take care of yourselves and do not be afraid,” he [said]( last month. “We’ll all have to get it, and we will be fine.”",9,381,billionaire salina liquid portfolio bitcoin,bitcoin one wealthiest backer yet ricardo salina pliego mexico third richest person said twitter post tuesday invested chunk liquid asset world biggest cryptocurrency many people ask bitcoins said salina billion fortune stake retail banking broadcast business according bloomberg billionaire index yes liquid portfolio invested bitcoin nearing record high doubling year partly driven fear major central bank easing fiscal stimulus debase currency digital asset advanced third session wednesday outperforming rival break performance attracted big wall street money manager including fidelity investment launched bitcoin fund summer macro investor paul tudor jones series tweet tuesday hedge fund founder ray dalio questioned cryptocurrency utility storehold wealth added might missing something bitcoin love corrected wealthy bitcoin backer include tyler cameron winklevoss twin worth billion cryptocurrency surge according bloomberg wealth index bitcoin gain helped make salina business interest share biggest listed asset conglomerate grupo elektra sab slumped year local television network family control dropped almost spokesman salina immediately reply email phone call seeking comment salina contracted covid last month said later tweet first invested bitcoin four year ago adding hold balance liquid portfolio precious metal miner salina family earned million dividend listed holding past two decade according bloomberg wealth index salina also used twitter comment pandemic previously called mexico health official stop imposing authoritarian policy contain spread virus took site reveal diagnosis take care afraid said last month get fine

It's unusual for Softbank to be bearish because they are known to buy billions of dollars of call options in big techs, which drives up the prices significantly. He didn't disclose how Softbank arrived at that scenario.

Does that mean Softbank will gradually wind down its positions in high-flying stocks and take up more defensive position? Maybe.

AppHarvest believes its Appalachian location between the East Coast and the Midwest could be a solution and bring jobs back.

Meanwhile, Covid-19, in addition to pointing out myriad flaws across the healthcare industry, has also exposed vulnerability in supply chains. AppHarvest is betting that supply chain disruptions related to the coronavirus pandemic will push large grocers to back more domestic sources of produce.

Then there is climate change. AppHarvest’s third facility, located in Berea, Ky., will be 15 acres and grow leafy greens.

0,jxgiee,IBM (NYSE: IBM) - An In-depth Stock Analysis,"# Introduction:

Good evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

&gt;\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&amp;D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

&gt;\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|
|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud &amp; Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big ""IF"" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

ARK Investment Management-a privately-held asset manager founded just six years ago-has been in the spotlight a lot this year thanks to its vocal founder and stellar investment record.

A recent regulatory filing suggests that Resolute Investment Managers—ARK funds’ U.S. distributor—plans to take control of the company early next year.

**It turns out that when Resolute acquired a minority stake in ARK in 2016, the deal also included an option that allows Resolute to purchase a controlling stake—if it wants—before the option expires in early 2021.** ARK, which manages $30 billion in assets, including $15 billion across seven exchange-traded funds, has more than tripled its assets in the past year alone. Now, Resolute is exercising its option to own a bigger piece of the cake.

Cathie Wood, ARK’s founder and CEO who owns 50% to 75% of the firm, is fighting the takeover. In a statement, Wood said she is “disappointed” about Resolute’s “unwelcome notice” of its intention to seize control of the business. “The remarkable success of our team is rooted firmly in a culture of transparency, collaboration, and employee ownership,” she wrote. “We do not believe that equity ownership by a party tangential to our business is in the best interest of ARK’s stakeholders.” Wood didn’t comment beyond the statement.

Ben Johnson, director of global exchange-traded fund research for Morningstar, highly doubts there will be a management change at ARK. ""Resolute has been operating largely at arm's length, distributing products and opening doors for the ARK team and not necessarily meddling in their day-to-day affairs and telling them how to manage money,"" says Johnson, ""What they want to do is to exercise the call option that is very much in the money right now, that's what they signed up on.""",11,294,cathie wood might lose control ark company founded,cathie wood might lose control ark ark management privately held asset manager founded six year ago spotlight lot year thanks vocal founder stellar record recent regulatory filing suggests resolute manager ark fund u distributor plan take control company early next year turn resolute acquired minority stake ark deal also included option allows resolute purchase controlling stake want option expires early ark manages billion asset including billion across seven exchange traded fund tripled asset past year alone resolute exercising option bigger piece cake cathie wood ark founder ceo owns firm fighting takeover statement wood said disappointed resolute unwelcome notice intention seize control business remarkable success team rooted firmly culture transparency collaboration employee ownership wrote believe equity ownership party tangential business best interest ark stakeholder wood comment beyond statement ben johnson director global exchange traded fund research morningstar highly doubt management change ark resolute operating largely arm length distributing product opening door ark team necessarily meddling day day affair telling manage money say johnson want exercise call option much money right signed

I could do a strike price for 25 and get a premium of $6.5

Why wouldn’t I write the 25 strike price and collect the nice premium, because they still have to wait for the price to be below 18.50 to exercise the option and drop below breaking even. If they exercise it then I’m still paying $18.50 a share as I would for the 19$ put option but if they don’t exercise the option then I get a much better premium.

0,jxm5q7,COVID-19's impact on the energy sector,"From: 

Key points:

- In the next couple of decades, due to the falling production costs, fossil fuels will continue to lead as the primary energy source, even with the increased investments in, and generation of, renewables. Oil will continue to remain the dominant source for energy for transport while in the heating sector, natural gas will take the lead role. Faster transition resulting in an earlier end of fossil fuel dependence is possible with strong and consistent sustainable development policies and efficient disbursement of investments; but there may not be major renewable projects that can be brought online in the immediate future. Therefore, at the global level, cheaper fossil fuels may continue to support demand and discourage clean energy solutions for some time.

- Major oil and gas companies are observing development of green hydrogen with keen interest. This is also a part of Europe’s green deal package with numerous investment support policies, pilot projects and a dozen roadmaps for using hydrogen for energy.

- Any major government support is likely to be for projects that accelerate the energy transition to a zero carbon emission economy or transition from the fossil fuels industry. The stimulus plans, government support and the post pandemic recovery of China (which leads the solar panels and wind energy sectors) will determine the pace of recovery. Despite government interventions, full recovery may not be possible given that many of the energy related infrastructure projects and related economic activities are shelved or indefinitely postponed.",6,245,covid impact energy sector,key point next couple decade due falling production cost fossil fuel continue lead primary energy source even increased investment generation renewables oil continue remain dominant source energy transport heating sector natural gas take lead role faster transition resulting earlier end fossil fuel dependence possible strong consistent sustainable development policy efficient disbursement investment may major renewable project brought online immediate future therefore global level cheaper fossil fuel may continue support demand discourage clean energy solution time major oil gas company observing development green hydrogen keen interest also part europe green deal package numerous support policy pilot project dozen roadmaps using hydrogen energy major government support likely project accelerate energy transition zero carbon emission economy transition fossil fuel industry stimulus plan government support post pandemic recovery china lead solar panel wind energy sector determine pace recovery despite government intervention full recovery may possible given many energy related infrastructure project related economic activity shelved indefinitely postponed

0,jxktcm,SuCoAsMa - the perfect hedge investment?,"Bitcoin has recently attracted substantial investments from a couple of companies like MicroStrategy (420 million USD) and Square (50 million), as well as a few large individual investors like Tim Draper (500 million), Paul Tudor Jones, and Ricardo Salinas (unnown amounts).  Some companies like Greyscale, PayPal, and Fidelity, while not investing in Bitcoin itself, have created services and derivative products that hope to extract substantial revenue from Bitcoin investors.  

These large players have justified their choice with the claim that Bitcoin is a good hedge investment because its market price is uncorrelated with the real economy or with the price of other traditional hedges, such as gold, real estate, or T-bonds; and its value is somehow likely to increase, even while those assets lose their because of the pandemic.  

This claim has some rational justification, since Bitcoin's does not have any significant interaction with the real economy or a ""fundamental"" value derived from expected dividends. Its market price is therefore not affected by business closures, unemployment, or a possible hyper-devaluation of the dollar.

Yet Bitcoin was not designed to be an investment instrument, much less a hedge against general economic crisis.  Its future is threatened by several structural flaws, such as its huge energy consumption (6 gigawatts, like that of the entire Detroit metropolitan area) and its association with criminal activities.  

Thus I call the attention of the readers of this subreddit to [SuCoAsMa](, a new alternative hedge asset that was designed from the ground up to for that very purpose.  It adopts the key features of Bitcoin's business model, that fully insulates it from the vagaries of the real economy, while eliminating its fatal flaws.   

It is possible that some old school financial experts who actually bother to read its Prospectus may not be favorably impressed.  However, as explained in that document, this new asset  has even better revenue potential for brokers and marketplace operators, if properly exploited.

Key points:

-  The University of Oxford confirmed that the Covid-19 vaccine it’s developing with AstraZeneca Plc produced strong immune responses in older adults in an early study, with pivotal findings from the final phase of trials expected in the coming weeks.

- The results of Oxford’s phase 2 study show that the vaccine is better tolerated in older people and produces a similar immune response in old and young adults. The study involved 560 adults, including 240 over the age of 70. That follows findings in older participants unveiled last month and data in July that showed the vaccine generated robust immune responses in adults ages 18 to 55. Older patients have been hardest hit by the pandemic, with the vast majority of deaths occurring in those over 60.

0,jx7306,Investing in the Oil and Gas Industry,"Hey everyone,
I’ve more recently started getting interested in the oil and gas industry, specifically Canadian and US companies. With covid, obviously stocks have taken a massive hit, but I don’t see them going much lower. Due to the cyclical nature of the industry, I believe we might be near the bottom and within 6-12 months as oil demand increases these stocks may rebound. My belief is that investing now might be a good opportunity to gain off the rebound of the industry since many stocks are basically as low now as ever in the last 10 years. My opinion is that I wouldn’t invest in the industry for a long time and hold, but as a 2-4 year play this might be good.

Again, I’m new to the industry and investing overall, currently a first year university student. This is more of a hypothesis and idea I think seems rational but I’d love to hear from people with more experienced opinions. The companies I have in mind are Enbridge and Suncor.

I haven't seen any discussion of the M1 chip on this subreddit (maybe something was deleted) so I wanted to bring it up and hear everyone's takes.

The ARM architecture has hitherto been largely restricted to low power consumption devices (phones, tablets), but the M1 chip may popularize larger, higher performance form factors, providing direct competition to Intel and AMD, who design chips with the x86 and x86-64 architecture, the typical architecture in most PCs and Macs.

Here is some reading I have done on the recent news:

0,jwv68n,Does it make sense to leverage your portfolio with rates so low?,"With interest rates so low, am I a sucker for not leveraging my portfolio?

#The math:

(Using Canadian values)

Cost of borrowing = 1.5% + benchmark -- gets lower over $100K

CAD benchmark rate = -0.0037% [0] -- fluctuates daily

Margin requirement = 30% to 50% [1]

Max S&amp;P drawdown in a given recession: 56% (2007) [2]

**So, with expected gains at 7%, and borrowing costs at ~1.5%, isn't this a no brainer?**

Leverage your portfolio to 1.5-2x, and enjoy 78% (7%/(7%-1.5%)) higher returns as long as you can hold onto the position.

#Risk:

Having margin requirement raised. Happened during the recent US election. Could push you into a margin call. Only about 1 week notice.

IB will just liquidate you without warning.

A recession could wipe you out if your leverage is at or over 2x if it's as bad as 2008.

---

#Other things:

Potential to earn income for lending out hard to borrow shares (not much)

Monthly fee of $10 and transaction fees

&gt;- Affirm filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “AFRM.”

&gt;- The installment loan and payments company, led by PayPal alumni Max Levchin, saw 98% revenue growth year over year, according to documents filed with the SEC Wednesday.

&gt;- Net losses dropped fell by roughly half to $15.3 million in the three months ending September 30th.

&gt;The eight-year-old company brought in roughly $510 million in revenue for the fiscal year ended on June 30 -- a 93% jump from last year, according to the filing. In the three months ending Sept. 30, revenue grew 98% year over year, while net losses fell by roughly half to $15.3 million.

&gt;Even if they don’t charge interest, Affirm earns a fee when they help a merchant make a sale. On the consumer side, they earn interest income on loans they buy from bank partners. Affirm also earns interest on some consumer loans. The rate they charge varies by consumers’ creditworthiness, but often starts at 0%.

&gt;Affirm said gross merchandise volume -- a key metric in the payments industry -- grew by 77% year over year. It has more than 6.5 million customers. Roughly 64% of loans on Affirm this year were taken out by repeat consumers.

0,jx3epw,Excellent Explanation of the Risks of Growth vs Stagflation in the Economic Recovery,"[](

Thought this was a great video to share to calibrate expectations for the upcoming 6 months to 1 year. It goes through what an economic recovery looks like for markets (the ""reflation"" trade) and which asset classes you would expect to outperform in the scenario. It also goes through the real risk of inflation and deflationary scenarios based on past data and trends. 

Highlights: 

\- The reflation trade is an expectation that a global economic recovery will take place that takes equities (especially global and emerging market equities) and commodity prices higher due to increased demand. Value and beat up sectors will outperform growth due to a recovery in demand and the relative lag. 

\- Reflation and inflation are not the same. Inflation can happen with or without economic growth, which leads to stagflation and likely a stall in asset price appreciation. 

\-  Reasons for possible inflation: Money supply has exploded higher along with savings rates. While it has not made its way into the economy yet, the impetus of economic growth could make banks more open to lending and people spending their savings; leading to higher money velocity and higher inflation. Fiscal stimulus to combat the slowdown could over reach and cause a spending spree by putting the money directly into the hands of individual who will spend it rather than banks who have been reluctant to lend. 

\- Reasons against inflation: Usually there is deflation historically after recessions due to lack of demand. We are likely entering into a double dip recession with increased lockdowns. 

\- Inflation could be destabilizing : Inflation will lead to higher yields for all debt. At record US debt levels and without higher growth, this could make it difficult for overextended companies to roll over debt increasing default risk. It will also lead to a depreciation in fixed income instruments, causing a domino effect of deleveraging due to asset prices falling. This was seen in taper tantrum of 2018. 

\- Yield curve control will attempt to backstop this possibility if it happens. 

\- Good to own bonds at the long end of the curve (ex. TLT) if you are long equities right now and want to protect against a deflationary response.",13,369,excellent explanation risk growth v stagflation economic recovery,thought great video share calibrate expectation upcoming month year go economic recovery look like market reflation trade asset class would expect outperform scenario also go real risk inflation deflationary scenario based past data trend highlight reflation trade expectation global economic recovery take place take equity especially global emerging market equity commodity price higher due increased demand value beat sector outperform growth due recovery demand relative lag reflation inflation inflation happen without economic growth lead stagflation likely stall asset price appreciation reason possible inflation money supply exploded higher along rate made way economy yet impetus economic growth could make bank open lending people spending leading higher money velocity higher inflation fiscal stimulus combat slowdown could reach cause spending spree putting money directly hand individual spend rather bank reluctant lend reason inflation usually deflation historically recession due lack demand likely entering double dip recession increased lockdown inflation could destabilizing inflation lead higher yield debt record u debt level without higher growth could make difficult overextended company roll debt increasing default risk also lead depreciation fixed income instrument causing domino effect deleveraging due asset price falling seen taper tantrum yield curve control attempt backstop possibility happens good bond long end curve ex tlt long equity right want protect deflationary response

0,jwkd5k,PLTR lock-up period is confusing,"Please help me make sense:

Per S1A 9/29:



Offering: 257,135,415 Shares

Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us under which they cannot sell, offer, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, lend, or otherwise dispose of shares of our capital stock, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction or arrangement that is designed to or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition or transfer of any of the economic consequences of ownership of shares of our capital stock, until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of our financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the “lock-up period”), except as described below and subject to certain other exceptions.

Starting on the first day of trading, the restrictions contained in the lock-up agreements will no longer apply to (i) an aggregate of 383,609,647 shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (ii) an aggregate of 68,149,214 shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units. The remaining 1,863,150,291 shares, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, will be able to be sold after the lock-up period, subject to applicable securities laws and our insider trading policy. In addition, certain record holders subject to market standoff agreements with us have not signed the lock-up agreement and are therefore not permitted to sell any shares during the lock-up period. If such record holders sign the lock-up agreement, up to an additional 37,369,371 shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, would be able to be sold during the lock-up period. 89,007,617 shares held by our Founders and their affiliates will be permitted to be sold immediately under the Founders’ lock-up agreements and will be registered for resale pursuant to the registration statement...""

Per  “One part of that complication was its invention of a direct listing with a lockup. When a company directly lists on a stock exchange, recent tradition holds that insiders are not locked up, which means that they will be allowed to start buying and selling their shares as soon as the company hits the market. For reasons that are known only to Palantir, the company decided to mostly block employee trading, limiting the float that can be expected when it begins trading.”

“Palantir will lock up about 80% of shares in the company, allowing about 380 million shares to trade on opening day. Eight million more shares will come on the market in November when certain restricted stock units vest for company employees, and other vested RSUs will also not be beholden to the lockup agreement as they come next year.”


******

Questions: 

1) 380 million shares refers to 383,609,647 in S1. Why does S1 list an offering of Offering of 257,135,415 Shares? 
******
2) I read ""Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us"" to mean current officers are subject to 80% lockup until 3rd trading date after Q4 results, around 2/17/2021. But based on Soros' statement and 13F, SCM sold 20%. Would 80% apply to former directors (his former employee?) or how else to make sense of this? 
******
3) When would 68,149,214 become available to trade? 
******
4) ANSWERED Given F-share ownership structure, Peter Thiel and Stephen Cohen (the software engineer, not the hedge fund manager) no doubt approved this lock-up period. It is not traditional 180 days, nor is it at all traditional in a direct listing. No doubt they would want to stabilize stock price with lock-up (no ECM support as with traditional IPO) but why time with Q4 earnings (realize answer is speculative)? 

Found this: 
So basically all early employees and investors are record holders. Let's not waste too much effort on Soros then. Main questions: Where did 257,135,415 on page 1 of S1 come from? How many shares are likely to be sold after lockup?

******
5) Why do FactSet and other sources list a float of 62%? Wouldn't it be less than 20% (B shares not traded until converted 1:1 and F shares never traded). 
******
6) 6) It gets even more confusing sadly....

9/29 Press release which seems to contradict the last S1A from 9/21:

As of September 28, 2020, there were an aggregate of 475.8 million shares of common stock that will be permitted to be sold starting on the first day of trading pursuant to Palantir’s market standoff or lock-up agreements. These 475.8 million shares consisted of (i) an aggregate of 407.7 million shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (ii) an aggregate of 68.1 million shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units in connection with the listing (“RSUs”). We estimate that, as of September 28, 2020, greater than 90% of the 475.8 million shares of common stock that are permitted to be sold under market standoff or lock-up restrictions consisted of outstanding shares of Class A common stock or shares of common stock underlying stock options or RSUs.

So is it 380 or 475 and thing bothering me most--why does page 1 of S1A say 257?

0,jwnwua,Using high-dividend stock to fuel growth stocks instead of DRIP,"Hi all,

We’ve all heard it before -  dividend growth portfolios lag the low/no dividend stocks/ETF in the long term. 

Not really looking to debate that. Let’s just assume/agree it’s true.

Has anyone ever done a calculation though (or know where to begin) to see how that would change if we allocate a percentage of the portfolio to a stable, high dividend stock/ETF - that instead of DRIP-ing into itself disperses its dividend equally to the portfolio, still skewed heavy growth?

Would that outpace a traditional growth portfolio or still lag it? 

All calculations always seem to be done with DRIP in mind rather than dividend re allocation to all holdings.
