,SavingMoney,"Throughout my time working at a New York based Private Equity firm, the angriest my boss (one of the Managing Partners at the firm) ever got at me had nothing to do with my job performance. Instead, he was disappointed with the steep rent price I was paying for my NYC studio. I explained to him it was the cheapest option within walking distance of the office. He immediately questioned me, “Did you negotiate the price?” I shook my head no. He responded with three words that have forever changed my perception, “Everything is negotiable”, then walked away.

I know he did not invent this quote, I had heard it before. However, I always attached “Everything is negotiable” to a used car salesman or Antique Roadshow, thinking it was just a corny sales line more than anything else. It was not until my Managing Partner, someone whom I deeply respect, recited this quote to me that I took it heart, and began to really analyze why “Everything is negotiable”.

**Why is “Everything is negotiable”**

The main reason “everything is negotiable” is because marketplaces are inherently inefficient. In a marketplace where a product is priced to maximize profits, a company forgoes potential profits on customers who are only willing to buy the product for a cheaper price. For example, picture the following conditions for a T-shirt company:

Cost of T-Shirt Production: $9.00

Number of Customers if T-Shirt Price is $20.00= 20 customers

Number of Customers if T-Shirt price is $10.00= 30 customers.

In this scenario, the T-shirt company company will make a larger profit listing its T-shirts for $20.00 ($220.00 profit), than $10.00 ($30.00 profit), and thus list the shirt for $20.00.

However, if the T-shirt company could *price discriminate* (charge different prices to different people based on their demand for the product), they would sell their T-shirts for $20.00 to the 20 customers ($11.00 profit per customer), then sell 10 shirts for $10.00 to the customers who are only willing to pay $10.00 for the shirt ($1.00 profit per customer). When price discriminating, as long as the company is making a profit (total revenue&gt; total cost), it always makes sense to sell a t-shirt at the price.

**Use Negotiation to Allow Price Discrimination:**

Two examples of price discrimination are age-based discounts (Senior Citizen or Children discounts) and time of week price cuts (gas stations will cut prices on specific week days, where only price sensitive customers will realize the discount). However, as you can likely tell, the problem with price discrimination is it's almost impossible to market. Both these examples capture some price discrimination, but do not come close to fully realizing potential discrimination. Thus, most companies will not price discriminate their products, and will find a single price that optimizes their profits.

The moral of the story is that companies *want* to price discriminate, but they are *unable* to. However, through effective negotiation, we (the customer) are able to expose the minimum price a company will be able to sell a product at. While in reality it is likely impossible to try to negotiate “everything” (I do not think you are going to be able to negotiate the price of a bag of Cheetos at a Walmart), there are many products you can negotiate which you may not have known are possible.

A few examples:

1. Hotel/ AirBnB prices: If a hotel is in off-season, or simply has excess rooms, they will likely be able to give you a discount. This is especially apparent during COVID, where the hospitality industry has been struggling. At the very least, you may be able to get some added benefit or a better room for the same price.
2. Media Subscriptions: Subscription based media companies (Netflix, Xfinity etc.) often charge a monthly postpay. However, they would prefer their users to prepay an annual subscription, as it guarantees customer retention and increases their cash flow immediately (to reinvest into the company). Thus, media providers will often provide a significant discount if you are willing to commit to an annual prepayment. The best part: you do NOT even have to negotiate. Third party platforms like Ubund will negotiate a 30%+ discount to your media subscription **for you** if you commit to a 1 or 2 year prepayment.
3. Furniture: Furniture showroom price is often much higher than its manufactured price. It is always worth attempting to negotiate on furniture before you purchase.
4. Gym Memberships
5. Electronics
6. Medical Bills

Tip for Negotiation: Increase Your Bargaining Power

Before you negotiate, always do your research to figure out how you can incentivize the seller to sell to you for less. Bullet 2 above is a great example of using research to increase bargaining power. These third party negotiation platforms understand that media companies prefer being paid upfront for a longer commitment, so they leverage the preference for an added discount for their customers. You can apply a similar negotiation tactic to anything you want a discount on. If you want a discount on a long-term stay on an Airbnb, explain to the Airbnb owner the benefits of your long term commitment (increased customer retention), then tell the owner you will only stay for an additional discount. Even if you do not have a bargaining angle, use the power of time. Tell the furniture salesperson that a couch you want is slightly over budget, but you are willing to purchase it immediately if provided a reasonable discount. Even if a negotiation attempt does not work, you will see over time that “negotiating everything” will consistently save you money.

,SavingMoney,"I'm always trying to think smart, and while everyone are going crazy for apps, referrals and such, I'll try to share something that will actually save you money - and possibly lots of them in the long run.

So why increasing your credit score should save you money? Well, having a better credit score will allow you to access more financing options at much better terms. For example, with FHA loans the down payment required varies in function of your credit score: the higher the credit score, the lower the down payment you will have to make and the lower the interest rates you will be charged (because you will be seen as a ""good borrower""). The capital that you won't have to put toward the down payment can be invested and grown and the smaller interest rate will save you quite a bit of money in the long run.

[I have made a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWb5Ejjfsec) where I explain how to improve your credit score, as well as going through the different type of loans and their credit score requirements. If you want to understand this better, build real savings for your future self and get educated on a smart way to save money then the video is definitely worth a watch. If you have any comments or thought just let me know!",t2_j1fvl,False,,0,False,An uncommon way to actually save money: improve your credit score,[],r/SavingMoney,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k2dbu9,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606552602.0,text,6,,,text,self.SavingMoney,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m always trying to think smart, and while everyone are going crazy for apps, referrals and such, I&amp;#39;ll try to share something that will actually save you money - and possibly lots of them in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why increasing your credit score should save you money? Well, having a better credit score will allow you to access more financing options at much better terms. For example, with FHA loans the down payment required varies in function of your credit score: the higher the credit score, the lower the down payment you will have to make and the lower the interest rates you will be charged (because you will be seen as a &amp;quot;good borrower&amp;quot;). The capital that you won&amp;#39;t have to put toward the down payment can be invested and grown and the smaller interest rate will save you quite a bit of money in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

,SavingMoney,"  As the holiday season comes closer, that need for cash is greater than ever. Whether it's getting the right gift for a loved one, or preparing for your COVID conscious gathering, money can feel especially tight, and making sure you budget correctly is more important than ever.  


   When we try to think of ways we can save, most of us go through the same list of ways we can cut spending on non-essentials. For example, going out to eat less, drinking less or cheaper alcohol, turning off the heat and lowering utilities are all ways people change their lifestyle to save money. While cutting out non-essentials is a great habit to practice, I believe there is a better way to save money (without changing your lifestyle) that is often overlooked.  


   Saving on software. When people think to save, they rarely think of saving through software, and when they do, they think of cancelling their subscriptions. However, one can easily save on almost all software companies by using their bargaining power and prepaying. Today, almost all consumer oriented software companies (SaaS) will provide a monthly subscription option. While this option provides little commitment to the user, over time a monthly subscription will be more expensive than paying annually. This is because for software companies, cash now is always better than future cash (they can reinvest in the business and it guarantees customer retention). Therefore, unless you plan on only using a software for only a few months, it makes sense to prepay annually for your subscription.  


   How can you prepay annually? First, many software companies understand the power of annual prepayment, and will offer a flex option of the ability to subscribe monthly for one price or annually for a significant discount. However, what if the company only provides a monthly subscription (etc. Netflix, Xfinity)? There are third party platforms like [Ubund](https://ubund.co/?ubmid=56) which will leverage annual prepayment for you. Simply pay through the third party platform, and they will immediately provide you with a 30%+ discount for your prepayment. These third party platforms make money by acting as an added marketing source for softwares, so they do not cost you more than going through the software company themself.  


   Saving money has never been easy and never will be easy. Almost always one has to change their lifestyle negatively in order to stay. However, prepaying for software is one of the few ways one can save without changing their lifestyle at all!

When I was growing up we did not have a lot of money. My parents worked hard and taught my Brother and Sister and I how to save and live within our means. Our first big lesson was: do not buy things you cannot afford. For a person who loves expensive stuff this was not a fun lesson, but, it is one I learned. We were told that if you cannot pay for it then you can’t have it. As a teenager I came to a quick realization – I needed to save where I could in order to get the things that I really want.

My saving strategy has never been to cut out things for a short period of time in order to save money. It is more about saving money daily in any way that I can. Since COVID I found saving money to be even easier than in the past. This article is going to focus on saving money by reducing the costs of the things you use every day (particularly if you are working from home due to COVID).

## How to Save Money

1. Use toll highways as seldom as possible and if you must use one make sure you have a transponder. In Ontario the cost to use the 407 ETR for 24 kilometers is $11.74 one way with a transponder and $15.94 without. If you are a toll road user and have started working remotely your savings per month would be $469.60 for transponder users.
2. Save your gas money. If you are now working at home, bank your gas money. This can create up to an additional $200.00 per month.
3. Make your coffee at home. If you skip your morning coffee out you can save an additional $40.00 per month.
4. Reach out to your Insurance company and request a reduction in your car insurance.
5. Do your laundry in off-peak hours which is 7:00-pm-7:00 am.
6. Try lowering your cell-phone charges.
7. Designate no spend days (you would be amazed how quickly the money adds up).
8. Make and stick to a grocery list.
9. Use coupons whenever you can.
10. Sign up for loyalty programs at all of the places you do business.
11. Do not buy books- borrow them from the library.
12. Save all of your change in a jar and do not touch it until the jar is full. Once it is full, roll your change and take it to the bank.
13. Do not pay any bank charges – switch to a bank with no fee accounts.
14. Use a programmable thermostat.
15. Turn off the tap when you are brushing your teeth.
16. Learn how to cook! If you rely on take out learning how to cook is a must.
17. Create a budget. It is important for you to know what your cost of living is. This is very important to know.
18. Work at paying off any high interest debt.
19. Consolidate your debt for a lower interest fee.
20. Get rid of cable (if you love cable request a lower package from your service provider.

If you do these 20 things you will be amazed at how quickly your savings will grow.

,SavingMoney,"Did you know that 60% of millennials cannot cover a $400 emergency!? For a nation riddled with debt, it is sad to see how many do not have an emergency fund. What is an emergency fund? It's a set amount of money you put aside with the sole purpose of bailing you out when s\*it hits the fan. And as you know, s\*it will always hit the fan. So why do so many people who know what the emergency fund is not have one? I think it's because many don't know where to start in creating one. I'm going to summarize some of the posts I've written to help anyone out there start building their emergency fund. For starters, your emergency fund should be between 3-6 months worth of expenses. I feel this should fluctuate based on your job, if you have a stable line of work then closer to 3 is probably good. If you are a freelancer and in and out of work, then 6 or more months is best for you. I certainly wouldn't go with less than 3. I know Dave Ramsey has people start with $1000, and I don't want to disagree with Dave but I have had two different instances with over $1000 emergencies. So how do you go about building your fund once you have a goal total in mind?

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you don't have an emergency fund then you need to get on a budget, or as I call it, a spending plan. This is the only way to free up money in order to start allocating it toward your goals. A real easy way to start saving money is to pay yourself first buy setting up automatic monthly transfers to your savings account. You simply determine how much you want to send to your savings account each month and make it a recurring payment. I have a [step by step guide here](https://walletdiagnostics.com/how-to-save-money-each-month/) for more information
2. It's smart to have your emergency fund completely separate from your checking account, as in you can't use a debit card to spend it. Most high-yield online banks allow simultaneous transfer of funds, so if an emergency comes up it takes only a few seconds to transfer the money. In addition, storing your fund at a high-yield savings account will earn you some extra interest.  [Here is an introduction](https://walletdiagnostics.com/high-yield-savings-accounts-a-guide-to-high-interest-savings/) to high-yield savings accounts for those interested.
3. You should know that emergencies happen even when building this fund. Do not get discouraged, if you have to dip into it then you continue on building it. With each dip into this fund you will be more thankful that you had it in the first place. My first $700 car emergency was the eye-opening experience I needed to understand how crucial always having this fund was. 
4. Know that it will take time to achieve your goal, but in the process you are also developing the habits required to build wealth. Once you have started tracking your spending to properly fund this account, you can now use those behaviors for other goals. Let's say that through budgeting you've been putting $200 per month to build your emergency fund. Once that fund is at your goal you now have that same $200 to put to a new goal. You've developed the skills and behaviors necessary to start building a true nest egg!

Hopefully these tips help inspire some of you to start building your emergency fund today. [Here is the original post](https://walletdiagnostics.com/emergency-fund-how-to-properly-build-yours/) where most of this was taken from.

,SavingMoney,"Hi there!

For as long as I can remember, I have lived paycheck to paycheck and then some. My credit card of about $1000 was maxed out way more often than it should have been, and I didn't really save.

For the past couple of months I've been putting aside some money, but only reducing costs reactively. It's been fun, but a real pain, easy to trick and hard to keep track of.

So now I've created one bank account for every expense I have (19 to be exact) and set up automatic fund transfers at pay day. Grocery money enters another account (grocery buffer), before being transferred to the grocery account every single day. (No more accidental over spending!)

I've also set up monthly transfers to an emergency fund, and to a car savings account!

I should have a surplus of 18% after everything is paid, which for the first month will cover bills I'm behind on and can be saved after that month.

,SavingMoney,"College is not cheap. Even after tuition payments, student loans, room and board and a meal plan, there are still many expenses for college students which add up over time. As a college student, despite prepaying for all of those expenses, I still always found myself spending significantly more than I budgeted for (unexpected take-out, various media subscriptions, deceivingly expensive textbook, alcohol etc.). By the end of all these expenses, I found myself virtually broke, with no money to spend on things I *truly* wanted at the time. 

While the easiest way to save more is to limit some of the impulsive spending I mentioned, I understand first hand as a college student that cutting impulse spending is extremely difficult. Oftentimes, when I try to actively cut out impulse purchases, I find myself giving in to a Doordash order (or equivalent) 3-4 days later. Simply put, impulse spending is something we enjoy as college students and makes us happy. Therefore, instead of trying to tell you to stop buying what you like, below are a few tips that will help you save money without cutting out the things you enjoy.

1. **Buy used books and resell**: Never buy brand new textbooks and never rent textbooks. Instead, buy the cheapest decent quality used textbook, keep it in good condition, and resell it once your semester ends. There are many textbook resell websites anyone can post on  (I cannot hyperlink on this page, but simply google “textbook resell websites”), or you can just resell the book to a college friend.  If you do your research, you can often make money through textbook arbitrage (reselling the textbook for more than you pay for it). 
2. **Get a time flexible job (Doordash/Uber):** Between class, studying, and extracurriculars, it can often be very difficult to find consistent time to work during school. However, for those who do have the occasional free time, working a time flexible job like Doordash or Uber is a great way to earn a couple of bucks quick. For Doordash (or an equivalent), you do not even need a car. Just bring your old bike from home up to school (or buy a used bike for cheap) and start delivering. Colleges have some of the highest demand for food delivery, so there will be no shortage of work and it can also double as a great workout.
3. **Prepay your subscriptions for a discount**: Whether it is your Netflix and Xfinity accounts, or even your online class subscription, find a way to prepay your subscription annually for an additional discount. Most companies will give a significant discount (30%+) if you commit to prepay for 1 or 2 years. If your desired subscription does not have a prepay option, there are third party platforms available that will prepay annually for you (and you will receive the same discount). 
4. **Passively Invest:** You do not need to be Warren Buffet or Ray Dalio to succeed in the market. In fact, you do not even need to know a thing about the markets, just invest in the market as a **whole**. Since the 1920s, the S&amp;P has averaged an annualized return of 10%. Compare this to your savings account which grows 1-2% or less a year, and the answer is obvious. Simply open a commission free brokerage account (like Robinhood), invest in an S&amp;P index fund (or equivalent), and increase your savings significantly.

\- look for special offers/promos/coupons: social media &amp; Google Search is your friend

\- sign up for a monthly pass: might be worth it if you order a lot

\- order more (&amp; share): order for more meals/people to share the fees

,SavingMoney,"Something I have always struggled with is budgeting. While after every paycheck I track how much money I spend on each expense (and think by doing so that I am budgeting and saving), I always feel myself short on cash and spending less at the end of each pay period. This habit I have created is because I am not *budgeting*, but I am *expense tracking.* 

Expense tracking is the act of noting every expense one incurs over a period of time and evaluating it based on your total savings. While expense tracking is a great way to determine how much of your savings have been allocated to certain expenses, it gives no projection of how to allocate your budget for **future** expenses. Through expense tracking, one is unable to properly weigh how they want to allocate their cash and savings over a period of time.

Expense tracking leads to short term lifestyle inflation, or the tendency to increase spending when their income increases. A personal example of lifestyle inflation is my relationship with food. Whenever I receive a paycheck (and my bank account seems bigger), my drive to cook seemingly decreases, and I begin to order take out significantly more than usual. A week and a half later, I will track my expenses, feel worse about my savings, and you will find me eating 89 cent canned chicken for 2 meals a day. While this tactic of expense tracking and momentary lifestyle inflation is one way of living life, most of us can agree that it is not our *ideal* lifestyle.

The key to living a consistent and well-balanced lifestyle is to budget. Successfully budgeting is to list out all of your future expenses at the beginning of each year, month, and even week. By budgeting, you can get a clearer picture of how much of your savings you are willing to allocate towards a variety of expenses (or investing). Instead of ordering take out 5 times in a row, and then eating cheaply and unhealthily for 2 weeks, budgeting allows me to spread out my take out days, and allows me to manage how I want to allocate spending on take-out and home cooked meals versus all other expenses. While budgeting may prevent you from experiencing the short-term euphoria of lifestyle inflation, in the long-term, budgeting will breed a more financially stable and ultimately happier lifestyle.

While budgeting is a necessity, it is not easy. Knowing just how much to spend in each expense category is extremely difficult and takes time to master. However, it is possible. Here are some tips I have to increase your spend predictability and to budget effectively.

1. Use a budgeting app: There are many budgeting apps which can help you list out your expenses and provide tips as to how to allocate your savings most efficiently.
2. Subscribe: Using monthly-subscription based services is a great way to predict your expenses. Whether it is a subscription meal box or a streaming app, subscriptions in any expense category give a clear picture of how much of your savings need to be allocated towards a particular expense. (To save money on subscriptions, I recommend you subscribe annually to all your subscriptions, or use a third party platform which will offer you an added discount for committing to prepaying a subscription annually).
3. Invest to Save: When budgeting, people often believe savings entails leaving a particular portion of their budget in a savings account (and earning 1-2% interest annually). By investing safely in index funds, mutual funds, or ETFs (which all require very little investing knowledge to use), anyone can easily earn 10%+ on their savings a year. Through investing, your budget will slowly begin to look bigger and bigger.

,SavingMoney,"Guys, I need your help. Do you try to follow the news? Have you run into issues trying to get news from different sources but found yourself spending too much on subscriptions? Let me tell you about what I have experienced. 

I am a college student who is trying to stay engaged with what is going on in the world, while also juggling many other expenses. I constantly hear that regardless of the profession I choose, being current on world events is very important. However, what I do not hear is advice on the best ways to accomplish this vague task. 

After diving in headfirst, inspired and motivated by the challenge posed to me, I started signing up and subscribing to all the news that I could. At first, I found little issues, as many places offer free trials, while some of the poorer sources are able to disguise their lackluster content for a time. I was a happy camper consuming news, with little cost (other than my free time!). 

As they say, “all good things must come to an end”. This was the case for me being able to have access to all the news I want without it hurting my financially vulnerable position. After my trial periods were up, these media outlets were asking me for all kinds of money that I was unable to pay. 

My initial thought was to try to find out what I could afford. After a little bit of digging, I realized that I could hardly even afford access to one high-quality media source (I decided, and still believe, that it is most important to consume quality media, and not misinformed, lackluster journalism). 

My financial constraints posed the problem that I was initially worried about – only hearing one angle of the issue/story. It is very important to be able to form your own opinions, and this simply does not happen by only consuming the news from one source. I was at a real crossroads. 

Lucky for me, I learned about a site that could help me manage and keep track of my subscriptions. This site uses a proprietary strategy to manage its users’ subscriptions. It was able to decrease what I was paying for my news by over 30%! This was a real game changer for me. Ultimately, because of this site, I am far more financially equipped to pursue the challenge/necessity of being a well-read aspiring professional by keeping up with current events.

After my trial periods were up, these media outlets were asking me for all kinds of money that I was unable to pay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial thought was to try to find out what I could afford. After a little bit of digging, I realized that I could hardly even afford access to one high-quality media source (I decided, and still believe, that it is most important to consume quality media, and not misinformed, lackluster journalism). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My financial constraints posed the problem that I was initially worried about – only hearing one angle of the issue/story. It is very important to be able to form your own opinions, and this simply does not happen by only consuming the news from one source. I was at a real crossroads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky for me, I learned about a site that could help me manage and keep track of my subscriptions. This site uses a proprietary strategy to manage its users’ subscriptions. It was able to decrease what I was paying for my news by over 30%! This was a real game changer for me. Ultimately, because of this site, I am far more financially equipped to pursue the challenge/necessity of being a well-read aspiring professional by keeping up with current events. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is not a perfect solution, as I am still paying plenty of money for news, however the site made my goals attainable. Does anyone else have other solutions? I would be super interested to hear! Please comment!&lt;/p&gt;

,SavingMoney,"If you're anything like me, you likely hate looking through any type of contract. To be honest, I do not think I have ever looked through a single “Terms and Conditions” agreement. While I assume most of you are the same as me in this regard, my tendency to both overlook the finer details in contracts and overlook payments in my bank account history has cost me hundreds of dollars. While I will give my solution to breaking this habit later, here is an example of how I lost money through negligence.

**The Never Ending Gym Membership:**

In the summer of 2019, I was interning in Boston and signed up for a two month student deal the gym was offering. Well, at least I thought it was two months. When I signed up, I mentioned to the front desk worker that I wanted the membership for only two months. When he nodded in response, I assumed I had signed up for the correct plan, and the membership never again crossed my mind for months.

Fast-forward to October, I am in my dorm and after a night of too much spending, I check my bank account to check the damage. Below my spending from that night, I see a $50.00 October charge from the gym I used in the summer. I keep looking and see another charge for September as well. I immediately call to cancel my subscription and nobody picks up. Within the course of the next few days, I email and call 20 different people within the company. Every person I spoke with assures me my membership is canceled but that they will “follow up with their superior” about a refund. For days I try as hard as I can to reach a “superior” and never get a response...I was not going to get the refund. But not only was I not getting a refund, a week later I received an email stating that my membership was to be cancelled in two months, and I was to be charged a $10.00 cancellation fee. Two months! I could not believe it. I continued to reach out and demand my money back, but the gym never picked up the phone and over Email explained to me my contract stated I must give 2 months notice before cancellation. While I hypothetically did give that notice (by saying at the beginning of the membership I only wanted it for two months), I ended up being charged for 4 months of a gym membership that I did not use.

While the gym had a history of being scummy (and recently filed for bankruptcy), my negligence was the reason I lost money. When signing up for the membership, I should have read the contract in depth and made sure the gym had on file that I only wanted the membership for two months. Furthermore, I also should have told my bank to block payments to the gym, but I did not know that was a possibility at the time. 

**Here are my tips to preventing money loss from negligence**

1. READ CONTRACTS: While I do not expect you to read every fine detail, find the part of each contract that explains how much money you owe and when. I also recommend you double check how the cancellation policy works.
2. Use credit, not debit: With a debit card, money is automatically withdrawn from your account. Once money is removed, it is gone. However, with a credit card, you are not charged until you pay off your card. This makes it much easier to refute any unwanted charge. 
3. Prepay your subscriptions: For subscriptions you know you want to keep, prepay them annually rather than monthly. Not only will you receive an added discount for committing to an annual subscription, but it will prevent you from receiving hidden recurring charges. If the service does not offer prepay, go through a third party platform (like [Ubund](https://www.ubund.co/save/?ubmid=56)) who will offer you an added discount if you prepay your subscription through them.
4. Check your bank account often: This seems obvious, but it is important to check your bank account regularly to catch hidden recurring charges before they add up. For example, for years I did not realize my Xbox 360 membership was recurring and it cost me hundreds of dollars. To prevent this error, set a recurring reminder in your phone to check your bank account.

Americans waste some 40% of all edible food, according to the National Resources Defense Council. Tossing food before its time is **literally throwing money into the garbage**. *The average American household spends over $2,000 per year on wasted food.*

There seems to be confusion around dates on packages in the states. According to the [USDA &amp; FDA](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/food-product-dating/food-product-dating), **the date printed on food labels is NOT an ""expiration"" date**.

This leads to a tremendous amount of unnecessary food waste because consumers think it's a magic date that makes their food go bad so they throw perfectly good food—out, unopened, only to be trapped in plastic in a landfill. While food companies and Big Ag profit off of this misconception.

What the dates mean:

* **Use By** The last date recommended for the use of the product while at peak quality. It is not a safety date except for when used on infant formula as we mentioned above.
* **Sell by** Tell the store how long to display the product for sale for inventory management. It is also not a safety date.
* **Best By** Indicates when a product will be of best flavor or quality. It is not a purchase or safety date. This is typically reserved for jarred or canned food.
* **The only food required by US federal law to have an ""expiration date"" is ""Baby formula"".** It has a [federally regulated expiration date](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/fsis-content/internet/main/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/food-product-dating/food-product-dating#9) and must be consumed within a given time period
* **Are Dates for Food Safety or Food Quality?** Manufacturers provide dating to help consumers and retailers decide when food is of best quality. Except for infant formula, **dates are not an indicator of the product’s safety and are not required by Federal law.**—[United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/food-product-dating/food-product-dating)

Food waste is something everyone can do their part to prevent. Collectively it can make great change in multiple ways.

**Food waste is not just about wasting food.** It's about wasting resources that went in to making that food: all the land, time, effort, labor, inputs like water, fertilizer, harvesting, processing, packaging, fuel, shipping/transportation, storage, grocery shelf time, money. *All for 1/3 of all those things to go into a landfill? How long does it take to grow a tree that bears fruit?*

&gt;Most Date Labels Are Not Based on Exact Science

One in seven households [with children](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance) in America are food-insecure, and do not know where their next meal is going to come from, as are over 41 million people in America.

&gt;Americans Waste $240 Billion in Food Each Year  
[https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-01-23/americans-waste-240-billion-in-food-each-year-study-says](https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-01-23/americans-waste-240-billion-in-food-each-year-study-says)

Why? Many people mistakenly believe that they should adhere closely to printed dates on food packaging. Americans dump *33 million tons of food into landfills each year. A typical family in the U.S. throws out 14% to 25% ( sometimes 50%) of the food they buy.*

If we take time to [educate ourselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR1Y-ieyfjU) about these dates we can save money, time, feed more people, and keep our landfills free of food. At the very least, we need to be composting. Food ""waste"" is a *nutrient resource*. Think of how nature works without humans on the planet. Plant and animal matter are not wasted in natural systems.

Anything that came from nature needs to go back to the soil. One teaspoon of healthy soil contains *more microbes than there are people on the planet*.

Those microbes are like trillions of microbes in our gut that enable our bodies to function properly. Both the microbes in our body and in our soil need a diversity of nutrients from different foods so they are enabled to choose what they need to do their jobs and thrive. Plants would be healthier, our air would be cleaner, we'd have less drought and get more [carbon in the soil](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/soil-carbon-storage-84223790/). The benefits of reducing food waste and using it as a resource are immeasurable.

&gt;Healthy Soil Microbes, Healthy People - The Atlantic  
There can be 10,000 to 50,000 species in less than a teaspoon of soil. In that same teaspoon of soil, there are more microbes than there are people on the earth. In a handful of healthy soil, there is more biodiversity in just the bacterial community than you will find in all the animals of the Amazon basin.

Food going bad is organic matter that needs to go back to the soil to feed the billions of hungry micro-organisms per one teaspoon of healthy soil. Not get trapped in a plastic bag in a landfill.

Most people don't know that grocery stores and restaurants are protected from lawsuits if they donate food to food pantries and organizations that fight hunger

&gt;The Good Samaritan Act was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, yet [it’s still a common misconception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xwLWb0lLY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11m32s) among the public and those in the food industry that a company can be liable if a recipient of donated food becomes sick after receiving the product.

At the very least, we need to be composting. Food &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot; is a &lt;em&gt;nutrient resource&lt;/em&gt;. Think of how nature works without humans on the planet. Plant and animal matter are not wasted in natural systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything that came from nature needs to go back to the soil. One teaspoon of healthy soil contains &lt;em&gt;more microbes than there are people on the planet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those microbes are like trillions of microbes in our gut that enable our bodies to function properly. Both the microbes in our body and in our soil need a diversity of nutrients from different foods so they are enabled to choose what they need to do their jobs and thrive. Plants would be healthier, our air would be cleaner, we&amp;#39;d have less drought and get more &lt;a href=""https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/soil-carbon-storage-84223790/""&gt;carbon in the soil&lt;/a&gt;. The benefits of reducing food waste and using it as a resource are immeasurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy Soil Microbes, Healthy People - The Atlantic&lt;br/&gt;
There can be 10,000 to 50,000 species in less than a teaspoon of soil. In that same teaspoon of soil, there are more microbes than there are people on the earth. In a handful of healthy soil, there is more biodiversity in just the bacterial community than you will find in all the animals of the Amazon basin.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/06/healthy-soil-microbes-healthy-people/276710/""&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In Today&amp;#39;s Landfills, Food Is Embalmed for Decades at a Time&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food going bad is organic matter that needs to go back to the soil to feed the billions of hungry micro-organisms per one teaspoon of healthy soil. Not get trapped in a plastic bag in a landfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How To Compost At Home&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/04/07/828918397/how-to-compost-at-home""&gt;https://www.npr.org/2020/04/07/828918397/how-to-compost-at-home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know? We&amp;#39;ve been able to feed &lt;em&gt;ten billion people&lt;/em&gt; since 2010. We DO grow enough food to feed the world. The problems are profit driven and political issues that prevent food from getting to those in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We Already Grow Enough Food for 10 Billion People (2010)&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know? You can save all your vegetable scraps in a freezer bag to make soup stock (vegetarian or meat based)? Onion and garlic skins and roots, carrot tops, parsley stems and roots, celery scraps, potato peels, carrot peels, more [keep brassicas separate for their own stock]. Freeze them and when you get enough, make your stock. Strain, then compost the solids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people don&amp;#39;t know that grocery stores and restaurants are protected from lawsuits if they donate food to food pantries and organizations that fight hunger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good Samaritan Act was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, yet &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xwLWb0lLY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=11m32s""&gt;it’s still a common misconception&lt;/a&gt; among the public and those in the food industry that a company can be liable if a recipient of donated food becomes sick after receiving the product. That’s why we’ve spelled out the specifics of the the protections offered to food businesses under the law...&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just Eat It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a funny documentary that proves you can eat very well with food that is wasted) &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR1Y-ieyfjU""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR1Y-ieyfjU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Filmmakers and food lovers, Jen and Grant, dive into the issue of food waste and pledge to quit grocery shopping and survive only on discarded food for 6 months. How hard is it to find food? Are they eating out of dumpsters, or do they find more than they bargained for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us eat food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us can prevent food waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food &amp;#39;waste&amp;#39; is an organic matter &lt;em&gt;resource&lt;/em&gt; for our hungry soil.&lt;/p&gt;

,SavingMoney,"Saving is not a one day ordeal. Just because you ordered the grande Pumpkin Spice Latte from Starbucks rather than the Venti, does not mean you now have the freedom to buy a $500 pair of Yeezys. In fact, not even does buying the grande all year instead of the venti give you the financial freedom to buy those Yeezys. The key to financial freedom and to be able to purchase the luxuries you truly want is to make saving a *lifestyle.*

What is making saving a lifestyle? The key is to consistently save over time AND across purchasing sectors. Do not just buy the grande all year, but also buy the generic over-the-counter drug, premake your meals, prepay your subscriptions, and invest in a water purifier instead of single use water bottles. By saving consistently over time and across all areas of life (rather than using one instance of saving to incentivize unnecessary spending elsewhere) you will be able to make saving a lifestyle and ultimately have the cash to make that purchase you never thought was possible. 

So where can you begin saving consistently? Here are a few saving habits I have inherited that I believe you can too.

1. **Buy the generic brand at the pharmacy**: Almost every name brand over-the-counter drug has an identical generic brand which your pharmacy sells. The generic brand typically costs 25-80% less and is the EXACT same thing. Consumers only buy the name brand (ex. Advil, Tylenol) because they do not know about the generic equivalent. So stop buying Advil and Tylenol, start buying CVS Ibuprofen or Rite Aid acetaminophen, and start seeing more money in your bank account.
2. **Use Pharmacy prescription saving websites**: To continue the pharmacy trend, pharmacies often overprice their prescriptions on purpose due the inelasticity of drug demand. However, most pharmacies have deals with third party companies who are allowed to offer an added discount to prescription users to drive demand. Examples of these companies include [Singlecare](https://www.singlecare.com/) and [GoodRX](https://www.goodrx.com/). While these discounts apply mostly to people with no or very limited health insurance, I recommend checking them out.
3. **Prepay your subscriptions:** Whenever you subscribe to any service (Netflix, Playstation Plus, SkillShare etc.) be sure to check if they have an annual payment option. There are huge benefits to companies if you commit to their service for a year, and they will often provide a significant discount. If a subscription service does not have an annual option, check if they are on [Ubund](http://ubund.co/?ubmid=56). Through Ubund, you can receive a 30%+ discount on your subscriptions if you commit to them for 1 or 2 years. Furthermore, by referring your friends to prepay through Ubund, you can receive an additional 5% discount.
4. **Get a coffee subscription**: Rather than spend $5.00/day for Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts, Panera offers unlimited coffee daily for $8.00/month. Do the math: if you spend $5.00 on coffee at Starbucks or Dunkin everyday, you spend $1825/year on coffee. If you spend $8.00 a month through subscription coffee: you pay $96/year on coffee. If you drink a daily cup of jo and have a Panera near you, this is an extremely easy way to save $1729.

What are other ways you guys save on a daily basis?

,SavingMoney,"When we first went into quarantine I was freaked out and didn't have any emergency fund saved up. Since I was stuck at home and not spending my usual $10.00 a day (on morning and afternoon coffee)  I think an Instagram ad got me motivated to direct that into automatic deposits into Stash (an investment app) and savings.

I felt silly investing with such small amounts of money, but it has slowly started to add up and I now have 3 months' rent saved without having to think about it.  I did a test on pulling money out of Stash and it only took a few days.  I can't believe I used to just let the money sit in PayPal for months collecting 0 interest or let my money sit in my chase savings which only has a 0.01 percent interest rate.

For me Auto deposits are the way to go, if I don't see money in my account I am not going to spend it.

If you are still pretty low on savings, I HIGHLY recommend Tmobile Money, they have a 4% interest on accounts under $3,000.00, and 1% if you have more than that. I switched my bill pay for my phone to the TMobile account and it kind of offsets my phone bill that way.

I am also really enjoying Yotta, I do an auto $25.00 deposit, and I get a little lottery ticket for every $25.00. I think it is the same odds as Powerball, but unlike the real lottery where you are almost guaranteed to waste $2.00 you are guaranteed to save at least $25.00. Its a really great gimmick to get you to save. It is supposed to be around 2% interest with the average prize winnings.

,SavingMoney,"**How to save money during the pandemic-driven recession**

If you are like me, you are not completely isolated from the pandemic-driven recession. There is nothing wrong with that simple fact, and it is likely not your fault. Tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs due to COVID. While some measures have been taken to insulate Americans from the effects of the pandemic, many are still financially vulnerable. 

What can we do? We can sit around and complain, or we can be proactive and take measures to help our wallets and our quality of life. I can’t speak for you, but I have elected to take proactive measures. There are several ways that I have been making a real difference and helping my financial goals during these trying times. In this article, we will explore some simple things that you can do to help out your wallet. 

Some should consider part-time work. Regardless of what your profession is, a part-time job is a great way to receive a bit of supplemental income, while you continue your job search. Personally, I have had success driving for Uber Eats. It is easy to sign up, you can make your own schedule, and it is a reliable source of income. Do any readers have other ideas for part time jobs? I would love to hear. 

Another great way to help your financial situation is to cut costs. Obviously cutting costs is a broad instruction. One easy activity that I recommend is to make a list of all the extraneous things in your life. This will be different for every person. For example, say that you are going through a tough spot due to the pandemic, maybe you were laid off or had your hours reduced. Despite your new reality, you still find yourself going to Starbucks every morning, buying fancy shampoo, paying for a gym membership that you rarely use, etc. After taking time and listing these things out, it will help you realize that you may need to change your behavior to adjust to your new, hopefully temporary, reality. 

Think you could use some assistance cutting costs? Don’t fret, there are resources for you. Ubund is a great place to start. It has helped my save hundreds by reducing what I pay for subscriptions. All I had to do was sign up. If you, like many of us, pay monthly subscriptions for tech, media, healthcare, or education, Ubund can help you save substantial money. Ubund leverages its community to negotiate on your behalf, while also implementing a pre-payment strategy that results in money back in the pocket of members.

,SavingMoney,"Would you rather have five dollars today or five dollars and fifty cents in a year from now? I would wager that most said that they would prefer five dollars today. Whether or not you are conscious of it, you probably understand the time value of money. For various reasons, money is more valuable in the present than it is in the future. There are all sorts of equations and thought processes that seek to explain the phenomenon; however, it is quite simple in my mind. The logic is based off what you can do with the money in the meantime. 

As we all know, money can be used for many things. It can be saved, spent, invested, etc. All of these activities provide benefit to the transactor. Traditionally, the time value of money is founded on the benefit of saving that money and earning a compounded interest rate. Here is the fancy equation that I was referencing previously:

**FV = PV x \[ 1 + (i / n) \] (n x t)**

Where future value equals present value, times one plus the interest rate earned, divided by the number of compounding periods per year (this can vary), to the power of number of compounding periods per year, times number of years. 

The key takeaway from the equation is simply that there is value in having money now versus having money in the future, as there is a small amount of money that can be made in the meantime. Moreover, the amount of value is fluid and undetermined. If your money is simply held in a savings account, you will typically earn a little bit less than 1% per year. Though this does not seem like much, it is not moot. Time value of money becomes even more realized if you are being more aggressive with your money. Say that you are invested in a mutual fund that seeks to earn a conservative 7% per year. In this case, your money becomes even more valuable in the present, as you can take more advantage of having that money now. But going back to the 1% interest in a traditional savings account, having $1,000 now would be equal to having $1,010 in a year. 

We have already examined how having the ability of saving and investing money creates value in having money sooner rather than later. Additionally, I suggest there is a third thing that gives present money value – that thing is spending. This mechanic relies more on human psychology than mathematical formulas. Having a desire for something, whether it is a house, car, pair of shoes, TV, etc., has the ability to distort logic. We have all been in a situation where we know that something will be on sale soon, or have a decreased price in one way or another in the future, however we did not have the ability to delay our urge, and ended up buying this thing immediately, ultimately costing us money. This is certainly human; however, it does demonstrate how having the ability to buy something now also serves to give present dollars added value over future dollars. 

Time value of money is an accepted fact and can be leveraged. Ubund, the blossoming fintech platform, leverages companies’ acceptance of time value of money. Ubund does this by offering to pre-pay subscriptions to companies in exchange for the total sum being marginally lowered. This is a win-win and is a large part of how Ubund adds value to the personal finance industry. Companies win by capitalizing on time value of money – they are receiving their subscription revenue sooner, thus they can invest it in other parts of their business. Ubund wins on behalf of its users by lowering the absolute sum of money that consumers have to pay. It is a truly symbiotic relationship that Ubund is seeking to create.

,SavingMoney,"Bargaining power is a fundamental piece of society. The term “bargaining power” is essentially alluding to the idea that the more people who support a common thing, the more power that thing has. In history, we have seen that ‘thing’ take on many shapes, such as a group, a cause, a revolution, etc. In this article we will explore the successes of bargaining power and how it is being utilized today.

I would argue that labor unions may be the purest form of bargaining power. Labor unions have been existent in America for hundreds of years. Many would attribute some of the rise in wages and better working conditions to the success of labor unions. Even though they are a point of political polarization for various reasons that we will not explore, it is a fact that the goal of labor unions is to advocate for their members. 

Let’s now focus on how labor unions achieve their goals. Say for example a factory has 10,000 workers and only 50 of their workers were part of the labor union trying to press the company to offer higher wages. Do you think that the labor union would achieve their goals? No, the company would simply fire the 50 troublemakers, replace them, and it would be as if nothing ever happened. However, say that 5,000 of the workers were part of the union and were threatening to strike if the company did not comply to the demands. In this situation, it would be far harder for the company to ignore or subdue the cause, because firing half of their labor force might make more inconvenience and hardship than meeting the demands of the union. 

This phenomenon is called collective bargaining. The more people who join a cause, the more likely the goals are to be achieved. We see things like this in everyday life. Some companies are even using this principal to aid their business model. In general, the more users that a company can attract to their platform, the more power that platform has. However, some thought-leading companies are even employing collective bargaining strategies in their business model. Let’s take a look at one. 

Ubund is a blossoming fintech company that employs collective bargaining as one of its core pillars.  Ubund’s goal is to offer financial solutions to customers via negotiating and pre-paying subscriptions to companies that use a subscription-based payment model. Subscription-based companies are most common in media, streaming, and SaaS (software as a service) companies. Essentially, the more users that Ubund represents, the more bargaining power that they have over the company. Just like we previously examined with labor unions, a company (in Ubund’s case it would be a company that collects subscription payments from consumers) would be far more likely to consider Ubund’s position if they represent a significant portion of the company’s users. The key difference is that Ubund is not making demands, like in the labor union examples, rather Ubund suggests a mutually beneficial solution – the consumers save money, while the company secures recurring revenue from its users. 

Bargaining power is a key principle in our society. It has been around for hundreds of years and has proven its influence time and time again. Ubund is a great example of how companies are leveraging bargaining power and using it to serve our community.

Do you think that the labor union would achieve their goals? No, the company would simply fire the 50 troublemakers, replace them, and it would be as if nothing ever happened. However, say that 5,000 of the workers were part of the union and were threatening to strike if the company did not comply to the demands. In this situation, it would be far harder for the company to ignore or subdue the cause, because firing half of their labor force might make more inconvenience and hardship than meeting the demands of the union. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is called collective bargaining. The more people who join a cause, the more likely the goals are to be achieved. We see things like this in everyday life. Some companies are even using this principal to aid their business model. In general, the more users that a company can attract to their platform, the more power that platform has. However, some thought-leading companies are even employing collective bargaining strategies in their business model. Let’s take a look at one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubund is a blossoming fintech company that employs collective bargaining as one of its core pillars.  Ubund’s goal is to offer financial solutions to customers via negotiating and pre-paying subscriptions to companies that use a subscription-based payment model. Subscription-based companies are most common in media, streaming, and SaaS (software as a service) companies. Essentially, the more users that Ubund represents, the more bargaining power that they have over the company. Just like we previously examined with labor unions, a company (in Ubund’s case it would be a company that collects subscription payments from consumers) would be far more likely to consider Ubund’s position if they represent a significant portion of the company’s users. The key difference is that Ubund is not making demands, like in the labor union examples, rather Ubund suggests a mutually beneficial solution – the consumers save money, while the company secures recurring revenue from its users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bargaining power is a key principle in our society. It has been around for hundreds of years and has proven its influence time and time again. Ubund is a great example of how companies are leveraging bargaining power and using it to serve our community.

,SavingMoney,"I recently wrote a post about this but wanted to post it here too. Have you ever wondered why utility companies want you to make your payments automatically? They tell you it’s for your convenience. It’s actually for theirs! Automatic payments ensures that they will get paid. For people who struggle saving money, I tell them to use this same methodology.
Much like utility companies want you to set up automatic monthly payments to them, you should set one up for yourself. Figure out how much money you want to save each month, and set a recurring transfer from your checking to your savings. By making this automatic you take out the psychological warfare of actually transferring money versus spending it. I’ve been using this method for years and it really helped me get started.

,SavingMoney,"If you are anything like me (or the average human), looking at your bank account is a roller

coaster of emotion. Usually, no matter how frugal I think I am, I am usually disappointed with the

amount of money in my account.

How can I prevent this disappointment from happening? Well, if I knew the answer to financial

freedom, I would be probably presenting this via Ted Talk, rather than by blog. However, I do

believe by budgeting in advance and actively questioning your buying decisions, taking that

weekly peek at your bank account may not be as dreadful as usual.

The key to smart budgeting is to first calculate how much of your monthly salary (post tax) is

going to necessities. No, that $500 Channel mini purse is not a necessity. Necessities include

rent, utilities, gas, insurance, food for three balanced meals a day, etc..

Once you remove my taxes and necessities from my salary, we are left with our disposable

income. Before you take “disposable” too literally, there is one more thing you should consider

before you start spending, investing. Unless you are satisfied with 1-2% interest in your savings

account (you shouldn’t be), it is imperative to take a percent of each paycheck and invest it into

the market, a retirement fund (unless you want to work forever), or an illiquid asset. Once you

remove a fixed portion for savings, now you have your true disposable income.

Before spending this remaining sum of money like a 10 year old at an arcade, I like to determine

what luxuries I am okay with spending more money on. For me, this luxury is going out to eat. I

love food, and I do not mind spending money on it as it concurrently reduces the costs of my

necessities (one less meal I need to calculate into my three balanced meals). Whatever it may

be: ice cream or Chanel purses, being cognizant of what you are willing to spend money on will

prevent you from spending on other luxuries that you will later regret.

While knowing when to spend is important for managing your disposable income, so is saving

whenever you can. Whether it is a service which automatically applies discounts to your online

purchases, or a [website](https://ubund.co/save/?ubmid=56) which provides additional discounts to your subscriptions for paying

upfront, any opportunity to save will accumulate and ultimately increase your disposable

income. So take a few minutes to plan out how much you can spend and where, follow in the

,SavingMoney,"Hi everyone,

I'm Simon, and I'm giving money savings courses to kids.

When I was a kid, I didn't had any money education or anything. In America, money is taboo and it's even more the case in France (where I'm living). 

As a teenager, I started making small jobs and putting money aside. When I grew up, I launched a small translation business and I made a bit more money. 

Then, I was able to invest my money with low-risk, long term investment. That's how I managed to make a nice living while still being young.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm giving courses to kids, to teach them how to manage money, and how to save money.

If you are a parents, and that you are looking for someone to give courses to your kids, you can check the link bellow.

,SavingMoney,"Hello! First time posting on this subreddit. I'm hoping to get some advice on this situation as it has been bothering me for quite some time since I would like to start saving and not have to live paycheck-to-paycheck. Roast me if you need to prove a point. 

I am in my third year of college and have always worked part-time in order to provide for myself. Some semesters even 2 jobs while doing full time work. During the peak of the pandemic, I was able to save up quite a lot of money in order to hold me over for rent and basic necessities for the following months in case I wasn't able to find work. Yet, my roommate has always influenced me to bleed money out of my ass even with work.  

Most of the time it isn't intentional though! I genuinely think that spending something that like coffee or outside food like every other week is OK. But with my roommate, they order out every other 3 DAYS and we typically order in a group so one person has to pay and the rest pay back. Guess what? I am ALWAYS the person to pay the whole order. I am fine with it on the occasional but orders are usually $30 to $80 (3 people). My other roommate pays me back immediately but it will take a month or so for this one to get back to me which is not good and very annoying as I have to constantly remind them. Coffee and little things are also a factor. 

I need to save because I will be graduating soon and start to pay off my student loans. What are some suggestions or budgeting advice? I'm not sure if I should get a credit card for emergencies but I also want to minimize my debt so my plan was to not get one until more than half of my student debt is paid. :P",t2_6eaxop3u,False,,0,False,My roommates influence has taken a toll on my savings.,[],r/SavingMoney,False,6,,0,,False,t3_itv6yt,False,dark,1.0,,public,10,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,10,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1600290733.0,text,6,,,text,self.SavingMoney,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!

,SavingMoney,"Whether it is the loss of a loved one, the loss of your job, or a missed opportunity, COVID-19 has affected everyone in some way. While the worst of the Coronavirus seems to be over, we are left with an extremely uncertain future. Will I be able to keep my job? Will I be able to find a job? Will I be able to complete my degree? Whether it is to pay for expenses right now, or to save for uncertainty in the future, almost everyone has a need to save money right now. 

Most blogs on how to save will give you a solution which is either a redistribution of your current wealth, a lifestyle change, or a combination of both. For example, common solutions to increase savings include cancelling your subscriptions, ordering take-out less, and creating an emergency savings fund. COVID-19 has taken away enough from us, and we deserve to be able to maintain the subscriptions and lifestyle we desire; and while it is important to have a savings and budgeting plan, it is not a concrete solution to saving or gaining money right now.

How can I have more money in my pocket now?

1. Pay less for the same subscriptions

An easy way to maintain your lifestyle and subscriptions while paying less is to sign up for Ubund, a financial services provider which negotiates and reduces your bills for you. For any subscription you may have (ex. Netflix or Xfinity), simply pay your complete subscription bill upfront to Ubund, and Ubund will leverage a community of upfront payments to immediately save you 30%+ on your bill. Ubund is an easy way to save money on subscriptions. I highly recommend checking them out: [https://www.ubund.co/save?ubmid=56](https://www.ubund.co/save?ubmid=56)

2. Strategically invest whatever you can.

Despite the steep economic impacts of COVID, the stock market continues to rise and it is a great time to be invested in the market. While money may be tight because of COVID, a great way to accumulate a substantial portfolio without making a large upfront investment is through micro-investing apps such as [Acorns](https://www.acorns.com/). Whether it is your Starbucks coffee or filling up your gas tank, Acorns will round up whatever you spend on your credit card to the nearest dollar and will invest the difference in the market for you. Acorns is a great way to use the stock market to your advantage without taking a significant upfront investment of cash. However, if possible, I also recommend directly investing a portion of your savings into the market yourself. While the uncertainty of COVID makes investing in high growth stocks risky, safely investing in the market is easy and will provide consistent returns. If you have no experience investing, I wrote an article explaining how you can easily go from no investing experience to becoming an informed and risk-averse investor.

,SavingMoney,"On April 1st 2019 I survived an attempted murder. Believe it or not, after almost two years, the men (millionaires) have pled down to misdemeanors after extending the criminal trial for over a year and a half thanks to the most expensive defense attorneys that the state of Ohio can offer. 2 facial reconstructions and a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia later, I am still here. Aside from all of that f*ckery, here are some tips to help you survive.

1. Look into VOC (victims of crime compensation). After making 50k the tax season before the crime happened, I just last week received my approval letter for a 4K slap in the face that should arrive in 2-3 weeks. It’s something. Although it won’t get my car out of impound or even clear up my bank account, or even put a dent in my overdue utilities, I have heard that they do better for some people. 
You will have to have done your taxes to prove your income at the time of the crime.

2. Apply for food assistance and never eat out again. Never buy precooked frozen stuff. Cook at home from scratch if you can. After my life came to a complete halt, cooking is one of the few things I enjoy now. 

3. If someone starts you a crowdfund. Make sure they’re someone you absolutely trust. The woman who made mine turned out to be downright evil. Also, people may come out of the woodwork and start a conversation by saying “so, I saw you had a gofundme, any chance you could spot me for...” tell them to fuck off. I was somehow able to make 9k from a crowdfund last nearly an entire year. (Just paying rent and utilities) you may have to let the rest go as I had to. 

4. Try your ass off to get a case manager through a non profit for people who are victims of crimes, most of them are underpaid and drop the ball. You have to pursue them unfortunately. 

5. Most of the people you used to call your friends and loved ones may abandon you as you will become a burden to them. Let life trim the fat. At times it has only been myself and whatever God I picked that day. (Tried damn near all of them). Do not expect people to pull through for you. If someone is there for you, you hit the lottery.  My family stole my restitution checks and told me they never came. Other than that you are mostly on your own. (This has little to do with finances unless you’re spending your own money to see people who don’t care about you after all) 

6. Cancel anything that’s autopay. Just do it. You can always resubscribe when you’re out of the woods. 

7. Change your type of banking account to one that is either prepaid or one that won’t allow you to drop into negatives. Usually this takes away some privileges that other checking accounts can have. Suck it up lol. 

8. Don’t you dare use any crowdfunded money or even your own to party or buy any sort of recreational drug. You will be shooting yourself in the foot and throwing gasoline on the fire.

9. If you have suicidal ideations during this, please reach out to a professional for help. Suicide hotline is 800-273-8255. I have been there time and time again through these last two years. (Felt this was absolutely necessary to add) 

10. Work if you absolutely can, when you can. I could not and still can’t, but have faired well with the bartering system somehow. Worth a try. 

11. Do not let people take advantage of you, you’d be surprised and appalled. People that seemed normal tried to buy me. And by that I mean offer to pay my bills in exchange for an unspoken agreement they made with me where I was to fall in love with them or let them have sex with me. THIS IS A THING. BE VERY CAREFUL. 

12. The criminal court process is slow. Very very slow. People seem to think they know all about the judicial system, I assure you they don’t. Talk to the prosecutor you’re involved with for updates on your case. It will not go as fast or at all the way that people say it will. You need to ask people with a law degree for advice if need be. Also, don’t hold out for any sort of restitution unless you file civilly, which can also take years. 

13. Apply for Ssdi if the situation calls for it. You will absolutely get denied twice and have to hire an attorney (they will take a percentage of your ssdi back pay) but they are necessary for you to get approved for something like that these days.

Believe it or not, after almost two years, the men (millionaires) have pled down to misdemeanors after extending the criminal trial for over a year and a half thanks to the most expensive defense attorneys that the state of Ohio can offer. 2 facial reconstructions and a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia later, I am still here. Aside from all of that f*ckery, here are some tips to help you survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look into VOC (victims of crime compensation). After making 50k the tax season before the crime happened, I just last week received my approval letter for a 4K slap in the face that should arrive in 2-3 weeks. It’s something. Although it won’t get my car out of impound or even clear up my bank account, or even put a dent in my overdue utilities, I have heard that they do better for some people.

,SavingMoney,"Hey all,

Not sure if this is of interest to anyone but I joined up this app where if you complete the tasks they give you free crypto coins for gaining the badges.

Once you download the app all you need to do is guess whether the bit coin price will have risen or dropped after 24 hours and stake the points as a gamble... it takes up about 2 minutes of your day and you get given 200 points a day to use for the guess. They have a competition going that the more points you have, the more of the bitcoin prize pool you win.

You can earn a max of 1750 of the CHSB coins if you get all the badges. These coins are worth about 8-9p at the moment but maybe the future they may go up... might just be worth trying to a get some and a few years down the line having a nice surprise pot to sell?

They don't ask for any bank or credit card details to use the app and it can be downloaded on IOD or android. As I say if this post manages to help anyone in the future then its been worth posting.

If you sign up using [swissborg community app](https://www.swissborg.com/community-app-referral)

,SavingMoney,"I feel it's imperative to write this.  Not for someone my age, but for the younger generation.  Looking back, I feel like the stance I took on my finances helped me get into a place where I can retire early.

And the thing is, saving money and acquiring wealth sounds hard.  But if your born into a thriving economy, then you have a real opportunity to save.

And that's with little to no knowledge of money.  No need to understand stocks.  REIT's.  Or even get-rich-quick schemes.  I know I never did.  Now later, this is all stuff you should learn.  Minus the get-rich-quick stuff, because most riches come through pure hard work and traditional investments.

&amp;#x200B;

I see so many people living beyond their means.  Especially the young generation.  You know, from 22-28, you want to be a baller.  Out there spending like your a rock star.

It's unfortunate.  And it's not entirely their fault.  After all, I was never target marketed by huge corporations to use a credit card or buy lavish goods at a young age.  At least I don't think I was.

&amp;#x200B;

Now more than ever before, I'm seeing younger generations spend every penny they make.  The signs are everywhere.  I drove by an small house in Burbank California last week with a Rolls Royce parked on the street.  And I know the owner is a resident in the house, because I've seen this car there for months.  And he's only about 25 and the home he lives in is his parents.

Now who knows the story, although I suspect it's similar to so many I see.  Young people leasing costly items, like luxury cars, in an attempt to show status.  It's really the wrong path.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's possible to save lots of money without having knowledge of anything about finance, because I've done it.  When I got out of college, I was a numskull.  I was about as far from a business minded individual as one could get.

&amp;#x200B;

But I knew one thing, how to not live beyond my means.  To not get trapped into purchasing luxury items.  I knew that, as a young bachelor, I needed next to nothing to be happy and survive.  It was the prime time of my life to save.

I managed to save 100k after college after starting my first job with just 25k in income.  4 years later, my salary was tripled, and I had 100k packed away and was well on my way to early retirement.  In my opinion, the early years of your life are the optimal time to save money.

&amp;#x200B;

It will not only set a tone for your life, as a saver, but it will also provide you with an emergency fund and investment options.

If your a new graduate, or even trying to save money as a young person, I'd suggest you take a minute to think about how you can save money quickly during your prime saving years.  I made a more extensive post, and your welcome to read more if your interested: [How I saved 100k on a 75k income in 4 years](https://wheretheroostercrows.com/how-i-saved-100k-on-a-75k-income-in-4-years/)",t2_7q6gfcse,False,,0,False,Save money in your prime saving years.

I drove by an small house in Burbank California last week with a Rolls Royce parked on the street.  And I know the owner is a resident in the house, because I&amp;#39;ve seen this car there for months.  And he&amp;#39;s only about 25 and the home he lives in is his parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now who knows the story, although I suspect it&amp;#39;s similar to so many I see.  Young people leasing costly items, like luxury cars, in an attempt to show status.  It&amp;#39;s really the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s possible to save lots of money without having knowledge of anything about finance, because I&amp;#39;ve done it.  When I got out of college, I was a numskull.  I was about as far from a business minded individual as one could get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I knew one thing, how to not live beyond my means.  To not get trapped into purchasing luxury items.  I knew that, as a young bachelor, I needed next to nothing to be happy and survive.  It was the prime time of my life to save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to save 100k after college after starting my first job with just 25k in income.  4 years later, my salary was tripled, and I had 100k packed away and was well on my way to early retirement.  In my opinion, the early years of your life are the optimal time to save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will not only set a tone for your life, as a saver, but it will also provide you with an emergency fund and investment options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your a new graduate, or even trying to save money as a young person, I&amp;#39;d suggest you take a minute to think about how you can save money quickly during your prime saving years.  I made a more extensive post, and your welcome to read more if your interested: &lt;a href=""https://wheretheroostercrows.com/how-i-saved-100k-on-a-75k-income-in-4-years/""&gt;How I saved 100k on a 75k income in 4 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,SavingMoney,"Friendly hello from canada here. 
So I have a short term goal for the next 6 months to save 50k
I dont know if I need a better budget or if I need a better mindset for the goal I want to achieve or what. I like to spend my money. I like to go for random trips or day trips. 
And in all honesty I am not entirely sure on what I want from this post. But maybe just a push in the right direction..

A little about this. I am a heavy equipment operator and I make 36/h with $140 non taxed allowance per day.  That will be around $3528 before taxes per week of 12 hour days. Plus 980 un taxed per week. I have taken in to factor of a 30% tax deduction so I am looking at approx $2469.6 after tax take home with the allowance $3450....
 so in the 6 months of planned work I have run a few numbers on the shift I will be working and it will be around $86,000. 
 Obviously I need to make a budget and see to what my expenses are over my savings. 

What I have already been doing is just spending whatever I want through out a week and whatever is left on payday from the week prior I put it all into my savings. It could be 50$or it could be 1500$ depending on what bill or expense I dealt with that week.

I am not here to boast about how much I make. Or anything like that. I am a little more humble than that I hardly like to discuss my finances with my partner. I am only here to see if my savings expectation is plausible or if I should pick another number slightly lower

If more information is needed then I will happily provide it.

,SavingMoney,"Wanted to get thoughts from an objective perspective


Currently I work a government job (canada) and make 28 an hour (maxes out at 32) with benefits, 9 - 5 and work about 50% of the time from home (love working from home) and pay 400 in rent. Dirt cheap. I rent off a buddy who bought a house.


Or I've been offered a job four hours away. Starts at 30 an hour and maxes out at 37.5 with benefits. This job would require moving and is in the same field that I went to school for - but tbh I'm not passionate about it - but I'm also not passionate about my current job either to be fair.


Moving would require either buying a house or renting, either way looking at 1000 - 1300 a month on rent or mortgage. Just not sure which is more worth while overall. Certainly financially this position works wonderful but the sooner I start the other the sooner I can hit that max of 37.5.

1. Chase Checking Account - this is my primary account that I use for everyday expenses. This is my “leftover” amount as these other accounts always have the same amount go in them. 

2. Chase Savings Account - this is where I dump as much money as possible and also pay my student loans out of. I put in more than my loans so I use it for occasional expenses too if I need to use it for a copay or something along those lines.

3. Joint Checking with my girlfriend - we live together so this amount is rent along with $35 as a random savings amount every check.

3. Capital One Checking - this one is really what helped manage my expenses and save. What I deposit  in this account covers exactly my solo monthly bills: phone, cable, streaming, dollar shave club,electric. 

5. Capital One Savings - I only throw $25 in here every check, but I never ever touch it! I actually have had this one longer than the capital one checking. I started this years ago as a means to save up for a new car, and that is the only time I have ever used it when my car got totaled a few years back. I kept it going and have not taken out since. 

Obviously this would work different depending on pay and frequency I suppose. I get paid weekly which makes the math easier, at least it seems that way.

,SavingMoney,"[click here!!](https://meetbeam.com/?r=CASH-hEDBGi)

I just wanted to share:
I had a savings account at HSBC and it started out with 2.2%APY payed out to me monthly. Because of covid and stuff (I assumed) that APY is currently at 0.7% and the highest savings account now is citibank with 1.4%APY. I wanted to switch to them but I decided not to, because I think that the interest will go down again. So I decided to give beam a try because I did not want to wait 1x a month to receive 0.7% interest. Its way too low 🙄🙄🙄

So I now use Beam as my main and only savings account. (I closed HSBC because the rate inflates all the time) My interest rate with beam is currently at 3.71% and they pay this interest to me daily. So I currently have $1,500 in it, and i will receive $0.15 daily basically. And everyday you will receive your interest payout with the current balance, so in my case I will receive 3.71% of $1,500.15 and so on.

It really does seem too good to be true, but i’ve used it for a while and it really is a great way to generate passive income from opening up a high-yield savings account so I thought I’d share it to you all. And in case you are interested you can use my link to get $10,000 credit. So if your interest is at 2%, you will get 2% of that $10,000 which pretty much makes the interest payout much higher because you have a higher base balance. 

I was really skeptical at first when I read some bad reviews, but I can confidently say that I have had no problems in transferring money in and out, although it takes a day or two extra to pull money in and out from the account. This savings account is like any other big name brands like Chase, Bofa, HSBC, Citibank, etc which are all FDIC insured so your money is safe. 

If you have any questions you can ask me, I’d be able to answer some general ones based on experience and you can use my link so that you get the extra bonus and $10k credit to temporarily increase your base balance for 30days!

,SavingMoney,"Do you know the key to saving money consistently? It's living below your means. All too often, our lifestyle tends to expand whenever we get a salary increase. If we're not careful, it expands beyond our means as we treat ourselves to fancy clothes, jewels, new cars, and vacations in sunny destinations. Often we feel obliged to put on a display of false prosperity to gratify our ego or to earn esteem in the eyes of others. But this primrose path leads to overdue credit card statements, missed payments, wrecked credit scores, sleepless nights, and eventually bankruptcy.

But if you put yourself in the right mindset, you can avoid this trap and start building your future upon a rock. 

Don't think too much about what other people are thinking or saying. Here are 7 ways to start living below your means.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Understand your means ; what is your take home pay? After taxes and other contributions?

 This is an important starting part. How much is it that you have to spend from month-to-month. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Downsize your home if possible.

Ask yourself:

Are you using all the space in your house? Do you have a guest room that no one uses? or only rarely? If so, consider moving into a smaller residence. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Save from the start (Pay yourself first)

Put money aside for savings first. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Reduce your non-essentials.

Do you need to buy coffee at the cafe?

Do you need to buy clothes every month? Does that really need to be part of your budget?

&amp;#x200B;

5. Keep track of your spending 

Put all your receipts in an envelope. Put everything in a spreadsheet. Keep track of services you've cancelled to make sure they aren't charging you. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. Create a budget (Do you have a budget?) 

Your money needs a map. Create zero based budget. i.e., Nothing should be left over after expenses and savings. 

&amp;#x200B;

7. Use credit card wisely.

Make sure you pay off balance regularly. Don't pay interest. Build credit rating. Get points and cashback.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, stop worrying about what others are saying about you and focus on building your long-term prosperity.

,SavingMoney,"The MCO Cryptocurrency Platinum Visa Card is what I consider to be the best Cash-Back card in the world right now. Its treated like a credit card at merchants but functions more like a pre-paid debit card. Although its called a Cryptocurrency card, you actually load it with Fiat like USD. It depends on ur membership level (1-5) but here is a list of some the best perks.

- Perk 1 - Up to 5% cashback on all purchases depending on your membership level. It might not sound like much but it will add up through the years. 
You spend so much money every year but wouldn't it be nice to have a universal cashback card that works on everything and not just select items. 
I personally have the 3% cashback one and its great. 



- Perk 2 - No Monthly Fees, No Annual Fees, No Upkeep Fees, No Minimum Balance Fees, No Hidden Fees and No Fees for the Card (Metal) or the Delivery.



- Perk 3 - You get a 100% Free Rebate back on your months subscription to Spotify, Netflix and Amazon Prime depending on your membership level. 
Level 2 gets you Spotify. 
Level 3 gets you Spotify and Netflix. 
Level 4 &amp; 5 gets you Spotify, Netflix and Amazon


I currently get free Spotify and Netflix each month which would normally cost me over $300 a year. You also get the cashback bonus on those so your actually gaining money to use those services for free.


- Perk 4 - You gain free unlimited membership to Lounge Key which gives you access to over 600 Airport's VIP area where you can shower, get free food and sleep in a bed. You normally have to pay $32 dollars to enter a single time and airport food is always so overpriced. 


- Perk 5 - No Fee ATM Monthly Withdrawal Limit up to a $1000.00 &amp; up to $10000.00 for Interbank Exchange Rates Monthly Limit.


- Perk 6 - Increased APY Interest for all Cryptocurrency and Stable Coins by 2-3% up to 14% for all currency in their wallet. This is a big one for me but probably doesn't sound like much to the regular household member. I'll go into more detail for those not familiar with cryptocurrency and why I think this is important.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


A guide to high Annual Percentage Yield

A stablecoin is cryptocurrency that is backed by the government and always has a fixed value. 
For example, 1 US Dollar = 1 USDC or 1 USDT

The company has a Minimum APY of 6% and goes up to 14% for stable coins so $10,000 USDC will give you anywhere from $600 at minimum to $1400 a year in interest earned depending on how long you lock it up for from 1 month to 3 months. You dont have to lock up ur money and still get a 6% APY. Alot of traditional banks don't come anywhere near those interest rates. This is a great way to gain passive income and having over 150k could potentially let you live off the interest alone. 


- Perk 7 - I don't get access to these but level 4 and 5 cards give you additional perks like free access to private jets, access to their inside club private investing firm and a bunch of other stuff like 10% off Expedia and airbnb


- Perk 8 - This isn't actually a perk but more like feature of the company. They give you a Credit Line thats equal to half of your wallet balance. 


For a full list of Perks then you can go to the website - https://crypto.com/en/cards.html. 


There are some requirements for those Perks so I'll use myself as an example. I have the Jade level 3 membership card and the requirement is to stake 500 MCO for 6 months. 
Each MCO is currently valued at $4.68 right now and thats a total of $2340.00 that I initially put down.
After the 6 month period is over then you can sell those 500 MCO anytime you want. This means that you could potentially both gain or lose money depending on the current value of MCO. After the 6 months are over with then you have to continue staking in order to gain access to those Perks but there isn't a lockup period anymore and you can liquidate your MCO anytime you want. 


MCO Price Analysis 

The company made a good strategic move which requires users to continue stake in order to gain access to those perks so the incentive to sell is lower than most coins which results in more people holding than selling. By the laws of supply and demand, this means that its actually more likely to increase in price. 
Its not much but I also gain the 8% APY on MCO during the 6 month mandatory staking period which comes out to around $187.00 a year. 


Risk Assessment 

- They are insured up to 360M 
- They are the first company to reach CCSS Level 3 (Crypto Currency Security Standard) 
- The company put alot of money down to get the original crypto.com domain name and went from 1 Million Users to 2 Million users in the last 6 months. I personally think they are on the verge of exploding. 


I recommend to people who just want to try it out to go for the Level 2 membership, the Red Card which has 2% cashback on all purchases, Free Monthly Spotify and ATM withdrawals. This one is relatively low risk and its perks are still pretty good. For this one, you need to stake 50 MCO for 6 months to get this card and you get 10 MCO for free just by registering anyways. Another 10 MCO if you use my referral code I think. After the initial 6 months then you can sell the 50 MCO to regain all the original money you spent anytime you want. For the record, you gain access to those perks immediately, you don't have to wait 6 months. The blue level 1 card has a 1% cashback and is free to sign up if you dont want to stake. 


Insurance 

This probably isn't needed but the safe thing to do would be to put a limit stop on the MCO after the 6 month is over and set it 10-20% below the market price in case it drops which would ensure that the loss is minimal. I anticipate that MCO will increase in price in the coming years as the company grows anyways but even if it does drops then I personally don't plan on selling because the cashback, free netflix, spotify and interest are going to save me more money in the long run.

The company Crypto.com has so far released this card for the US, EU, some countries in Asia is currently going to release it for Canada next.",t2_13mqgk,False,,0,False,High Yield Interest &amp; Amazing Cashback card,[],r/SavingMoney,False,6,,0,,False,t3_hbvs48,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,1592610921.0,,[],{},,True,,1592577731.0,text,6,,,text,self.SavingMoney,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MCO Cryptocurrency Platinum Visa Card is what I consider to be the best Cash-Back card in the world right now. Its treated like a credit card at merchants but functions more like a pre-paid debit card. Although its called a Cryptocurrency card, you actually load it with Fiat like USD. It depends on ur membership level (1-5) but here is a list of some the best perks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perk 1 - Up to 5% cashback on all purchases depending on your membership level. It might not sound like much but it will add up through the years. 
You spend so much money every year but wouldn&amp;#39;t it be nice to have a universal cashback card that works on everything and not just select items. 
I personally have the 3% cashback one and its great. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perk 2 - No Monthly Fees, No Annual Fees, No Upkeep Fees, No Minimum Balance Fees, No Hidden Fees and No Fees for the Card (Metal) or the Delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perk 3 - You get a 100% Free Rebate back on your months subscription to Spotify, Netflix and Amazon Prime depending on your membership level. 
Level 2 gets you Spotify. 
Level 3 gets you Spotify and Netflix. 
Level 4 &amp;amp; 5 gets you Spotify, Netflix and Amazon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently get free Spotify and Netflix each month which would normally cost me over $300 a year. You also get the cashback bonus on those so your actually gaining money to use those services for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perk 4 - You gain free unlimited membership to Lounge Key which gives you access to over 600 Airport&amp;#39;s VIP area where you can shower, get free food and sleep in a bed. You normally have to pay $32 dollars to enter a single time and airport food is always so overpriced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perk 5 - No Fee ATM Monthly Withdrawal Limit up to a $1000.00 &amp;amp; up to $10000.00 for Interbank Exchange Rates Monthly Limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perk 6 - Increased APY Interest for all Cryptocurrency and Stable Coins by 2-3% up to 14% for all currency in their wallet. This is a big one for me but probably doesn&amp;#39;t sound like much to the regular household member. I&amp;#39;ll go into more detail for those not familiar with cryptocurrency and why I think this is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guide to high Annual Percentage Yield&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stablecoin is cryptocurrency that is backed by the government and always has a fixed value. 
For example, 1 US Dollar = 1 USDC or 1 USDT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has a Minimum APY of 6% and goes up to 14% for stable coins so $10,000 USDC will give you anywhere from $600 at minimum to $1400 a year in interest earned depending on how long you lock it up for from 1 month to 3 months. You dont have to lock up ur money and still get a 6% APY. Alot of traditional banks don&amp;#39;t come anywhere near those interest rates. This is a great way to gain passive income and having over 150k could potentially let you live off the interest alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perk 7 - I don&amp;#39;t get access to these but level 4 and 5 cards give you additional perks like free access to private jets, access to their inside club private investing firm and a bunch of other stuff like 10% off Expedia and airbnb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perk 8 - This isn&amp;#39;t actually a perk but more like feature of the company. They give you a Credit Line thats equal to half of your wallet balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a full list of Perks then you can go to the website - &lt;a href=""https://crypto.com/en/cards.html""&gt;https://crypto.com/en/cards.html&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some requirements for those Perks so I&amp;#39;ll use myself as an example. I have the Jade level 3 membership card and the requirement is to stake 500 MCO for 6 months. 
Each MCO is currently valued at $4.68 right now and thats a total of $2340.00 that I initially put down.
After the 6 month period is over then you can sell those 500 MCO anytime you want. This means that you could potentially both gain or lose money depending on the current value of MCO. After the 6 months are over with then you have to continue staking in order to gain access to those Perks but there isn&amp;#39;t a lockup period anymore and you can liquidate your MCO anytime you want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MCO Price Analysis &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company made a good strategic move which requires users to continue stake in order to gain access to those perks so the incentive to sell is lower than most coins which results in more people holding than selling. By the laws of supply and demand, this means that its actually more likely to increase in price. 
Its not much but I also gain the 8% APY on MCO during the 6 month mandatory staking period which comes out to around $187.00 a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk Assessment &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are insured up to 360M &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are the first company to reach CCSS Level 3 (Crypto Currency Security Standard) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company put alot of money down to get the original crypto.com domain name and went from 1 Million Users to 2 Million users in the last 6 months. I personally think they are on the verge of exploding. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend to people who just want to try it out to go for the Level 2 membership, the Red Card which has 2% cashback on all purchases, Free Monthly Spotify and ATM withdrawals. This one is relatively low risk and its perks are still pretty good. For this one, you need to stake 50 MCO for 6 months to get this card and you get 10 MCO for free just by registering anyways. Another 10 MCO if you use my referral code I think. After the initial 6 months then you can sell the 50 MCO to regain all the original money you spent anytime you want. For the record, you gain access to those perks immediately, you don&amp;#39;t have to wait 6 months. The blue level 1 card has a 1% cashback and is free to sign up if you dont want to stake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurance &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probably isn&amp;#39;t needed but the safe thing to do would be to put a limit stop on the MCO after the 6 month is over and set it 10-20% below the market price in case it drops which would ensure that the loss is minimal. I anticipate that MCO will increase in price in the coming years as the company grows anyways but even if it does drops then I personally don&amp;#39;t plan on selling because the cashback, free netflix, spotify and interest are going to save me more money in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

,SavingMoney,"Hi Reddit! 

For the last 3 years I have struggled to save money. I finally came up with a solution that works. 

When you have cash and you buy something, put the rest of the bills away in an envelope. You buy a soda for $1, break a $20, put $19 away. In a physical envelope, not your bank. That's very important. I will explain later why. 

If you have ones in your bag, shove em in the envelope. You found money? Put it in the envelope. Whenever you see a bill and don't need to spend it. Throw it in there.  But never EVER count what's in the envelope. 

The reason why you do this is because temptation. If you know you have money, you will want to spend it. That's why piggy banks work, you have to break them in order to get the money, therefore losing the object in the process. It's designed to hurt a little bit. 

If you have an envelope with bills stuffed in it, you don't know how much you have. 

And you can't borrow from it. It has an imaginary lock on it. You spend it and you can just throw the rest of your money away because then, what's the point? You're not saving, you're still hurting yourself.

After a while you can count it. It'll be a lot of money, since you will be throwing random bills in there. $20, $10, $5, $1.

As a kid I loved saving money. We never got money for doing chores. Which I understand. So I would clean neighbors yards, houses, and or groom their pets. A handful of times my dad would take the money. My neighbor gave me $50 for mowing her lawn and cleaning up her yard. I was around 12 or so. My father took the money and said we needed it for food. Once I turned 15 my dad was constantly on me for finding a job. The day of my birthday he took me to fast food restaurants and made me apply for jobs. If they didn't hire me he would yell at me and say it's my fault. After a few months I got my first job at McDonald's. This was back in 2008. I was getting $6.25. My first paycheck was around $70. I got yelled at for it not being big enough. This went on for 8 years. My dad eventually gave me $25 a week for ""food"". But I wouldn't spend it so I could save up. Because anytime I said I wanted or needed something he would say no and that I don't work hard enough. After 8years I decided to move out and keep my own paychecks. At first I didn't know how to save up. I would spend my money as soon i got it. I worked hard and bought 2 vehicles and anything I wanted it. Later on I sold both vehicles, walked to work which was only 2min away. Sold anything I did not use and lived a very cheap life style. With in 3 months I was able to save 10k. I got engaged and ended up spending all that and 10k more. I became very depressed and went back to living off paycheck to paycheck. I fell into debt and couldn't afford a decent vehicle.

I always make an excel sheet to track one year of savings in advance just so I know how much to expect in my savings account.

,SavingMoney,"Think about the day you graduated high school. What was the date?  

Now go to google and ask google how many days it has been since that date. 

Write down the number of days. 

Multiply the number of days it’s been by 5. 

Add a dollar sign in front of this. 

Do you have this amount saved? 

If yes then you have succeeded in saving at least an average of $5 a day since becoming an adult really.  

If not then you have failed at saving an average of $5 a day. 

Select Yes if you have saved at least $5 a day. Select No if you haven’t using this method. 

What if you divide that number in half. 
If you don’t have that amount then you have not been able to save $2.50 a day. 

Puts in into perspective that people work 40 hours a week... sometimes for years... and yet can’t or don’t save even $2.50 a day since graduating high school.

,SavingMoney,"Hi Everyone,
Support me if this helps. One of my first posts but I'll try to squeeze as much in as possible (Might be a bit jumbled) as certain points may help certain individuals. One thing that helps me with saving and being able to get into 6-digit figures is habit. Habit of saving and always looking to find ways to save. I grew up below average and thus always felt like I needed to make sure I can stop struggling (e.g.hungry, missing out on events, couldn't pay for trips when friends took them, couldn't eat better food, limited to many other things, you get the picture). All these struggles and problems forced me to make sure almost 100% as possible to never get back to this  struggling state. Now in my 30s, I can tell you that once you build a habit, it becomes easy and part of your life to save. I can extend this all day but understand that you save and then eventually learn to invest those savings into bigger and better things (Will share more in later posts). As I've been to a few other countries, I've seem people happy with a small fraction of what has become the norm (Large homes, luxurious foods, expensive clothing, new or newer cars, etc.) in American life. The most important statement I can share is ""If you want to live different and be able to save and invest more than others or the above the average, you have to live a lifestyle and make decisions that are DIFFERENT than the average person"". For example, 80% (Just estimating) of people buy new or expensive cars instead of saving $5K a year or buy $2000 worth of snowboarding equipment when it can be bought for a couple hundred dollars. Many more examples but just trying to make a point. Be different; make different decisions. I won't go deep into investing in this post. Finally, here is a list of known and experienced actions that have worked for me and many others that will free up cash (And make money) and help put you in a better position (These are actually things I do and not random tips). Also, I always try to explain or give examples and not just plain out make a statement.  All may not apply to you hut be creative. Main thing is be consistent. Everyone has a different formula but most formulas have derived from a combination of others' formulas. 
- Always think about saving a fraction of your income whether it is 10%, 20%, etc. Don't think you cannot because you don't make enough (Big mistake). You cannot tell me you always make just enough money and cannot save. Again, build a habit. 
- Don't buy new cars. Waste of high insurance, registration, and depreciation costs. I've purchased $3000 Honda Civics and the last 3 have lasted over 6 years without any problems. Just be smart and test drive the crap out of the car when buying. Spend the $100 for the diagnostic test if not comfortable. 
- If you have a house/condo/etc., rent out rooms. I've done this for the last 8 years. Imagine if just 1 room allows an extra $600/month in your pocket. 
- Use online sites for deals. Example: slickdeals.ney
- Use online coupons. They are everywhere. Just google it. 
- Cancel expensive TV services. Use streaming services. 
- Check for cheaper car and home insurance annually or every 2 years, especially if yours keeping going up. 
- Use apps for food discounts. Bad example but check McDonald's app. Always free or BOGO offers. Same with many others. 
- I can dive into this way more but save and invest in stocks. If you don't  know much, just keep investing in Vanguard funds (e.g. VTI). Don't listen to people who say stock investing is gambling. Short-term and day trading stocks are gambling, proper long-term is not. Stock funds and economy always trend up long-term and even during times they go down, your dividends would get reinvested. Again, so much more to this. 
- Once or if you have extra money down the road, buy an investment home to rent out. Good tax savings due to mortgage interest, property tax, etc. 
- Start researching credit cards that offer points and cashback. A lot more to this but possibly start researching Chase credit cards. Check ""Chase quadfecta"" in google. 
- Buy furniture on Craigslist, Nextdoor, Facebook Marketplace, etc. Items could also include lawn mowers, appliances, etc.
- Most people stockpile so much used items. Sell all your unused old items on those sites I just mentioned. You'll be surprised. 

Still enjoy life. No need to do any major cuts. Some people try to skimp on things that eventually ruins their comfort (e.g. trying to cut down on A/C). This list is not everything (So much more) but I hope it helps you generate ideas. This is more like tid bits from a lot of things we can discuss. As mentioned, be different, be consistent. I will post more later and also respond to questions/comments.

If there is a savings ticket on it of an amount smaller then $20.00 then put the savings amount away. Example is if the groceries ticket has a ""Total savings"" on it saying $1.60 you put that away too…

I created my account on April 3, 2016. I thought others may find it interesting to see how I have used the platform and how the first \\~ 4 years have been. When I first signed up for the app I was looking for a way to simplify my tracking of my net worth and cash flow because at the time I had a decent of amount cash sitting in my savings account (earning nothing) and was in the process of figuring out better uses as I currently didn’t “need” the money. At the time I didn’t fully appreciated the impact my student loans had on my financial situation, so when I saw negative $47,117 net worth after accounting for all my assets and liabilities – it was honestly a little disheartening. Had I not started tracking this information – I don’t think I would have come this far.\n\n**Net Worth Change**\n\n[Net worth change from 4.3.16 to 2.1.20](https://preview.redd.it/j6qjd0m47ce41.jpg?width=1088&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0df250dcb670999d66bf139f6a879bffcf2a522)\n\nOver the past \\~ 4 years (3 years / 10 months) my net worth has increased by $112,712 – starting at a net worth of about negative $47,117 to positive $65,595. The quick negative spike around June 2017 was due to an adjustment by my student loan servicer that got picked up by Personal Capital and essentially doubled the student loan balance – yes, I did panic for a couple seconds when I saw this back then 😊, but was fixed pretty easily.\n\nAround April 2018 (2 years) is when my net worth finally broke even - 0 net worth!! As you can tell from the chart my current trend has been positive with only slight dips here and there – usually impacts from the market, but also is likely related to movements of assets from one account to another and the slight delay in information updating. The hope is to keep this trend up for the long-term.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nMy “strategy”, if you can call it that, is not really original or super complex. When I first created the Personal Capital account I was researching “Roth IRA” and learning more about the benefits. At work I had already been contributing to my 401k for just under 3 years at the full employer match contribution level, which is 6%. I have slowly increased that contribution over time as I receive raises from my job. Raising my contribution % is more of a ploy on my end to help me limit lifestyle inflation. The Roth IRA was appealing to me as I could earn more from my money than just keeping it in a savings account, but also have access to the contributions (not the interest) penalty free should an emergency arise. This is not to say that this is my emergency fund, but more so that it gave me some peace of mind.\n\nI had enough in savings that I could put in the full contribution amounts for 2015 &amp; 2016 ($5,500 limit both years) in early April 2016, so I opened a Vanguard Roth IRA. Ever since then I have maxed out my Roth contributions every year (2015 – 2019), which is $28,000 total (2019 limit was $6,000) in contributions.\n\nAround March 2018 I started watching more Dave Ramsey, which motivated me to start taking on my student loan debt. I will say I am not 100% Dave Ramsey the whole way, but at the time it resonated for me to start looking into paying debt. I had only been paying minimums on my debt up until this point. When I first started Personal Capital my student loan debt was around $73,523 and in March 2018 it was $69,162. By March 2019 my debt was around $40,363 (\\~$30k change) and a couple loans completely closed.  You can see from the above screenshot that liabilities are still around $39k, which unfortunately is due to debt re-payment not being a priority due to personal matters much of the rest of 2019 – the goal is to change this in 2020.\n\nOverall, my strategy has been an “exciting” combination of saving money and paying off debt. I will note that although this is pretty common sense, leveraging something like Personal Capital that can provide feedback on the financial choices you are making can be really powerful (help you calibrate) and motivating.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHopefully this was somewhat interesting to read. I wrote this to reflect on what I have been doing over time from a financial health perspective, but maybe this gives people some ideas of ways to start documenting their own personal finance journey.

Now I need to know the best way to save on printer ink. I need HP 934 for black and HP 935 color. I’m nervous about buying an off brand because of quality. And I’ve found plenty on Ebay but a lot of the ink is expired. I don’t know if that’s very bad or not. So if anyone has any great suggestions on how to save on printer ink I would appreciate it!

And I’ve found plenty on Ebay but a lot of the ink is expired. I don’t know if that’s very bad or not. So if anyone has any great suggestions on how to save on printer ink I would appreciate it! I’ll mostly be printing in black and mainly just for coupons.&lt;/p&gt;

Save glass jars from Pasta or Salsa for free glasses and storage just don't heat them. 

Unplug your tv and set your house to a low temp to save on gas and electric. I went from 79 dollars to 52 in one month and that was a huge help. Actually unplug anything your not using. 

Find a low cost store if possible- Aldi's and Save-a-lot are great sources of food that save your lots of money. 

Thrift Stores are amazing- I furbished my house beautifully for less then one hundred dollars! You can buy amazing clothes and even appliances or Couches for cheap!

Try to spoil yourself with at least twenty dollars a month. A little cost that will ease your impulses so you don't spend too much money later one and feel like you are undervaluing yourself.

It is essentially free money on top on the Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales.  It takes very little effort to set it up and some sites even allow you to get some back from instore as well as online.  So when you are deal hunting this weekend remember to use these types of sites, all you have to do is go to them first then be redirected to the store\'s site and then shop like you normally would.\n\n# [Amazon Smile](https://smile.amazon.com/)\nIf you are too lazy to sign up for a cashback site, please at least consider using Amazon Smile.  This costs you nothing and Amazon donates a small percentage to a charity of your choice.  All you need to do is select a charity your first time on the site and that\'s it.  Its not much but it does add up and every little bit helps these great causes.  \n\n\nMore details can be found [Here](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/).\n\n---\n# [Rakuten (Formerly Ebates.com)](https://www.rakuten.com/r/BOBZGA?eeid=28187)\nThis is a pretty well known one; used to be ebates.com but they got bought out and converted to Rakuten last year.\n######Pros:\n\n* Easy to use and has a nice browser extension that also includes coupons\n* They have promotional cashback values that go as high as 40% but normally around 5-15%.\n* Offers In-Store cash back as well as online.\n* Above average customer service in case something doesn\'t show up.\n\n######Cons:\n\n* The Major downside is you get paid quarterly, so every 3 months you request a payout for the previous three months. Must have above $5 to cash out, Cash earned how will be paid on Feb 15th.\n\nTheir payout schedule can be a pain to start but once you get going its not as big of deal. The in-store is nice and easy to setup but they do only have a limited number of stores to use that feature in.  My favorite thing about this site though is when they offer double cash back since you really can get some great deals then.(they are doing one of these promos this weekend).\n\n\n######Referral Program: \n[[Ref](https://www.rakuten.com/r/BOBZGA?eeid=28187)] - [[Non](https://www.rakuten.com/)]: They offer a $10 promo if you sign up through a ref after you spend $25 or more.\n\n\n---\n# [Swagbucks](https://www.swagbucks.com/refer/bobzarch1)\n\nSwagbucks is not just for offers and surveys but they actuall offer a pretty decent cash back program as well.  Since SB is more a jack of all trades type of site their Cash Back percentages are not always the best compared to Rakuten but they run promos that sometimes make it worth it. Since they are this type of site though, you can more easily cash out and if you need to top off your credits to reach a cashout limit its easy to do a quick survey/watch an ad/etc to make up the difference. \n\n######Pros:\n* Easy to use and has a browser extension if you want it.\n* Faster cashout, usually around 30 days before you get your credit then you can instantly cashout via one of the methods (Paypal, giftcards, etc)\n* Can do more things on their sites to maximize your total credits or push to a higher cashout\n\n######Cons:\n* Sometimes lower percentage (but sometimes higher, hit or miss)\n* Subpar customer service if something doesn\'t show up or credit properly\n\n######Referral Program: \n[[Ref](https://www.swagbucks.com/refer/bobzarch1)] - [[Non](https://www.swagbucks.com/)]:   Like Rakuten they offer a $10 credit when you spend $25 in a store. You do need to go to ""Swag Ups"" and activate it though, don\'t forget this step.  They also have a Bonus $3 Cashback Promo for your first purchase until December 24th.\n\n___\n# [TopCashback](https://www.topcashback.com/ref/cashbackbob)\n\nThis is similar to Rakuten where it is mostly just a Cash Back Site. It has been around forever and will continue to be there forever. It offers similar percentages back and really it become personal preference at this point which one you use. I used to use this one more but switched to the other 2 almost exclusively now but there is nothing wrong with this one.  It all depends which stores you shop at most often and choose the site that gets you the most bang for your buck.  If you don\'t do the extra stuff on SB this could be better since you can cash out sooner than Rakuten. Depending on the type of Cashback you could withdraw as little as 1 penny.\n\n######Pros:\n\n* Easy and has pretty much every store possible along with easy browser extension and mobile app\n* Been around forever so tons of good reviews and resources online about it\n* Easy cashout system that allows you to get your money when you want it\n* Fun ""offer"" page to see what is trending so you don\'t miss out when certain stores have promos.\n\n######Cons:\n\n*  Only downside would be sometimes not as high of percentage. \n*  Only way to earn money is via cash back but they offer lower cashout limits so depending on your method that may or may not be an issue.\n\n######Referral Program: \n[[Ref](https://www.topcashback.com/ref/cashbackbob)] - [[Non](https://www.topcashback.com/)]:   Not sure who copied who but just like the rest they have a $10 signup promo that you get added on to your first payout.\n\n---\n\nAt the end of the day just remember not to buy things you don\'t actually need. Cash Back is awesome for the things you are already buying but just because something is ""On Sale"" doesn\'t mean its a good deal. Remember to do your guys homework and not to overspend this weekend.  Feel free to post here or DM me with any questions, tried to keep this as short as possible so might of left off something.\n\n---\n---\n\n\nAnother small tip is to check out a site like [Raise.com](https://geta.raise.com/RWALTERS3590) to buy a giftcard that is on sale and then use it to buy on the store\'s site. Be careful about this one as not all the cards are instantly approved.\n[[Ref](https://geta.raise.com/RWALTERS3590))] - [[Non](https://www.raise.com/)]:Extra $5 for Ref\n\n---\nEdit #1:  Was reminded that one of the best coupon sites [RetailMeNot](https://www.retailmenot.com/) also has a Cash Back program. I don\'t have first hand experience with it but its worth looking at if only because of their reputation for saving people money. Even if you are doing Cash Back from another site it might be worth checking RetailMeNot to make sure you have the best coupon codes (assuming you aren\'t using one of the other sites browser extensions which does that function)\n\n---\nEdit #2: Since this post is blowing up people recommended i expand on the saving.  Swagbucks and Rakuten both have great browser extensions but if you don\'t want to use one of them the top extension to save you money today is [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/eohwabb).  This is the extension you have probably seen everywhere in the last year but it automatically checks thousands of coupons on every site for you to find the best deals.  This is huge for this weekend as almost every site had multiple codes in use.  It is almost guaranteed to save you money for this weekend and in the future.', 'author_fullname': 't2_cdlik', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'PSA: Remember to use a CashBack Site this weekend', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/WorkOnline', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_e2ogim', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.95, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 93, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 93, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': 1574961797.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1574924344.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.WorkOnline', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us on this sub are either on a budget or trying to find some extra money so when you are shopping this weekend don&amp;#39;t forget to use a cashback site.

This is the extension you have probably seen everywhere in the last year but it automatically checks thousands of coupons on every site for you to find the best deals.  This is huge for this weekend as almost every site had multiple codes in use.  It is almost guaranteed to save you money for this weekend and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2y178', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'e2ogim', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'Bobz12', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 13, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/WorkOnline/comments/e2ogim/psa_remember_to_use_a_cashback_site_this_weekend/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/e2ogim/psa_remember_to_use_a_cashback_site_this_weekend/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 315849, 'created_utc': 1574895544.0, 'num_crossposts': 1, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/e2ogim/psa_remember_to_use_a_cashback_site_this_weekend/,t3_e2ogim,

I'm back six months later with a new version of the budgeting spreadsheet I made. Earlier this year I posted the spreadsheet I made for myself and it really resonated with people. As I got more and more feedback I found places where I could improve and develop the sheet into something easier to use but still useful. \n\nYou can find pictures of it [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/63LxvUQ)\n\nA bit of background on me and why I made this- and also why it's made the way it is. I grew up poor and was never taught about HOW to handle money. If we had money it was already needed for other things. Food, Bills, all of the money we had already had a place. This made me get a mentality that if I had money I needed to spend it before something came up and the money would go. It's unhealthy, but it was the only thing I knew until I moved out. I was taught that money would disappear if I didn't use it, so I just USED it. Even now I still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if I'm not careful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother problem I faced is that I have ADHD, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. This spreadsheet is made so you only focus on ONE number. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have made this sheet- and previous versions of it- with three goals in mind:\n\n* That it be easy to use\n* that I can focus on one daily number while supporting my long term goals\n* that it be a good starting place for people who have never had another budget\n\nThe sheet is divided into a few different tools.\n\nBudget:\n\n* Select your pay schedule, add any extra income/tips that you get monthly and select the percentage of that income that you want to save.\n* the credit card section allows you to input up to five cards and adds your monthly car payments to your expenses\n* The expenses area is where you'll add all of your itemized expenses. You can also select when your bill is due during the month- allowing you to see if early on in the month your spendable is different from later on in the month. \n\nYour budget summary at the top is the breakdown of all the information below. YES I know pie charts aren't useful for everything- but that is useful to visually digest information. Look and see where your money is going, see if you spend more than you earn, and finally- see how much money you can spend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sheet focuses on giving you ONE number to remember. Daily Spendable. If you want to spend money throughout the day you just have to make sure you DONT go over that number and you will always have enough to cover any other expenses. \n\n I don't work well with a lot of budgets because I have issues imagining the big picture. By giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget I can make sure that on any given day I haven't spent more than I'm allowed to- and if I do i can see where I'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.\n\nThere are a few extra features too- a large purchase calculator that lets you figure how long youd have to save to buy a larger purchase. It includes a monthly tracker that lets you see what youre spending realistically vs what you've budgeted for and finally a daily tracker for further breakdown. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally \n[LINK THREE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vekdgMTyWO9VSTyDN-8XVr4I-WGuDfpbiZd6-vrpf_Y/copy)\n\nChanges: Added a bi weekly option so you stop asking me to redo math, please yall, its an open spreadsheet you can edit it but i did this one for you.

This spreadsheet is made so you only focus on ONE number. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have made this sheet- and previous versions of it- with three goals in mind:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That it be easy to use&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;that I can focus on one daily number while supporting my long term goals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;that it be a good starting place for people who have never had another budget&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sheet is divided into a few different tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Budget:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Select your pay schedule, add any extra income/tips that you get monthly and select the percentage of that income that you want to save.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the credit card section allows you to input up to five cards and adds your monthly car payments to your expenses&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The expenses area is where you&amp;#39;ll add all of your itemized expenses. You can also select when your bill is due during the month- allowing you to see if early on in the month your spendable is different from later on in the month. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your budget summary at the top is the breakdown of all the information below. YES I know pie charts aren&amp;#39;t useful for everything- but that is useful to visually digest information. Look and see where your money is going, see if you spend more than you earn, and finally- see how much money you can spend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This sheet focuses on giving you ONE number to remember. Daily Spendable. If you want to spend money throughout the day you just have to make sure you DONT go over that number and you will always have enough to cover any other expenses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t work well with a lot of budgets because I have issues imagining the big picture. By giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget I can make sure that on any given day I haven&amp;#39;t spent more than I&amp;#39;m allowed to- and if I do i can see where I&amp;#39;m borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a few extra features too- a large purchase calculator that lets you figure how long youd have to save to buy a larger purchase. It includes a monthly tracker that lets you see what youre spending realistically vs what you&amp;#39;ve budgeted for and finally a daily tracker for further breakdown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally \n&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vekdgMTyWO9VSTyDN-8XVr4I-WGuDfpbiZd6-vrpf_Y/copy""&gt;LINK THREE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Changes: Added a bi weekly option so you stop asking me to redo math, please yall, its an open spreadsheet you can edit it but i did this one for you.  Also NOTE: Yall i wont make an excel version. Some of the functions/graphs break, and the whole point of this is that i made it for myself and i want to share it freely, what means not a paid program- i&amp;#39;m sorry!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False,

We all know that in order to manage monthly expenses and use our income the right way, budgeting is important.

#2.) A box or container to put said book in 
#3.) A spot to put said box in that's out of sight and out of mind, that's also kind of annoying to get to (more on that in a second) 

Each week (or if I get a tip at work) I go to the bank and buy $2 bills from them. There's something about the $2 that I just can't spend them, whether it might be ""good luck"" or the rumor that they are ""rare"" I'm not sure.

Put each bill inbetween the pages of the book, put the book in the box and now here's your chance to find a creative hiding place that has a decent amount of ""opposing force"" on your mind. 

For instance, say you don't typically go in your basement, put the box down there somewhere, underneath something, in something else, behind something, etc. So when your brain says ""Let's spend money you've been saving!"" Hopefully this spot is just difficult enough where then it becomes ""Well then I need to go downstairs, all the way in the back, under ""xxx"", then I have to open the box and then flip through all the pages in the book to get some money."" And here's where the $2 bill part comes into play, a LOT of people don't want to spend them! (Where if it was just ""regular"" bills, you wouldn't care now would you?) 

Here's why I use a book vs just putting bills in a box, you don't see the amount you have. You flip to an empty page, place a bill in there, close it and you're done. (Unfortunately if I see a dollar amount in my checking account, I just assume we have money.....) 

Also, if you're not sure where to find $2 bills, just call any local bank. Luckily where my employer takes the deposit the main teller always carries them.

If you've made it all the way down here, please comment and let me know your thoughts. Maybe I'm absolutely bonkers for thinking such an idea, but at least in my case it seems to be working fairly well.",t2_3h7ymrwp,False,,0,False,My clever way of saving $$$,[],r/SavingMoney,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cucfrh,False,dark,0.89,,public,13,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,13,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1566587700.0,text,6,,,text,self.SavingMoney,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my fiancee and I are just terrible at saving money. I have tried setting cash aside in a separate bank account, tried putting cash in a box, tried the app Digit, tried Acorns, nothing seems to work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently live in an apartment, we have some debt, I need a new car soon, we are going to buy a house in the future, we are getting married this fall, how can we do any of these without a dime in our savings? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my method, and in one months time I have been able to save about $130. &lt;/p&gt;

Beyond that there are many other ways that you can earn on the site which you will find listed below along with my thoughts or experiences of using them.\n\nUnlike most other cryptocurrency faucets and 'micro-task' websites, Cointiply initially pays you in their own coins, which are pegged to fiat (the United States dollar specifically). But when you come to make a withdrawal you will be paid out in bitcoin or doge (your choice).\n\nThe basic faucet payout is obviously very small as they all are, but compares very well to other faucets. You start off getting just over half a cent each time, which goes up to double that if you are a regular user and get the daily bonus. Making a claim rolls for a random number, and if you get a prime number you also get an extra bonus.\n\nOther ways to earn include:\n\nWatching videos: They actually have some good video channels that can be good to watch. If you watch three of the ads that display between videos on the channels they offer you a reward. \n\nAds don't show after every video, but if doesn't take too long to get to three. This can be a good one to just put on and leave to play while you do something else. \n\nAfter three ads have played you don't get any more, so its probably best to leave it on while you are in the room and keep an eye so you can close one channel and open another each time you reach three ads to get a reward.\n\nPlaying games: They have quite a lot of games to play as well, and some are quite fun. You get a payment each time you play a game, which won't add up to anything significant tbh. \n\nI wouldn't recommend doing this as your sole method of earning crypto, but if you’re bored and you are the kind of person who sometimes plays random free casual games then you might as well come here and get a little something back for your time.\n\nPaid to click adverts: On average you get something like a tenth of a cent for viewing an ad for a few seconds. Hardly any money, but hardly any time either. \n\nTasks and offers: Earning larger amounts requires going to the offer wall and completing surveys, downloading and testing apps, completing special offers from various companies and other easy small tasks.\n\nThe earnings are good but there may not always be something which appeals to you. \n\nI like to check in regularly to browse the offers but to be a little bit picky about which ones to do, which is OK if you at least take a few seconds to do the faucet and PTC ads each time so that it is never a completely wasted visit.\n\nCPU mining: This is the only one I wouldn't recommend as you earn almost nothing and use electricity which costs a lot more than you earn.\n\nReferrals: You can also add to your earnings by sharing your link and introducng other people to the site.\n\nMultiplier: Gamblers can also play a dice game in the hopes of increasing their balance.\n\nInterest: If you keep coins in your account past the minimum payment threshold then you can earn 5% per year on your balance. This is quite generous compared to similar sites.\n\nThe mimimum payment threshold is around $3.50. This is relatively high, compared to other faucets, but it isn't so high that you will struggle to ever reach it.\n\nOverall it’s a good site and if you are looking for a casual way to earn a small amount of crypto without having to spend much time on it and perhaps having a little fun and entertainment along the way then I would recommend using Cointiply.\n\n[[Referral Link]](https://cointiply.com/r/PnBx9)\n\n\n[[Non Referral Link]](https://cointiply.com)"", 'author_fullname': 't2_3ra6x4g3', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Cointiply Review: earn Bitcoin playing games, watching videos, doing surveys and more.', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/BeerMoneyCasino', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': None, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_cia1sg', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'restricted', 'ups': 6, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 6, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': 1564189600.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1564211758.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': None, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.BeerMoneyCasino', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cointiply has a range of different ways that you can earn money on their site, which you can later withdraw as Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you first login to the site you are presented with the coin faucet, a simple feature which lets you claim a very small amount of free &amp;#39;coins&amp;#39; every hour.

Store ad: I browse the site circular to see if there are any items on sale that I need. I make a list of any items that I would like to buy. 

Coupons: I go online and use a coupon database such as http://clipmunk.southernsavers.com/public_coupons
Using a database helps you easily find printable coupons for the items that you would like to buy, just by typing in the name.

Ibotta: Ibotta is a rebate app that allows you to scan your receipt after you make a purchase to get cash back. All receipts get cash back with the ""any item"" rebate. Some rebates listed are for any item in a category, such as ""any milk"" or ""any toothpaste"". Other rebates are specific to certain brands. You can also earn cash back for online shopping, similar to ebates. Sign up here and get a $10 bonus when you scan your first receipt: https://ibotta.com/r/boqilon

Checkout 51: Checkout 51 is also a rebate app that allows you to scan your receipt after you make a purchase to get cash back. It works just like ibotta and they add new offers every week. Sign up here and get a $5 bonus with your first receipt: https://checkout51.app.link/mz3OJnO2YR

The best deals happen when you are lucky enough to combine 2 or more of these money saving ideas. For example, last week my grocery store had a sale on Pampers diapers. I combined a printed coupon, an ibotta rebate and a checkout 51 rebate to get an amazing deal.

,SavingMoney,"Our earth is dying and our natural resources are depleting. If we continue with this rate, we will be left with no coal to power our electricity plants, no water or food to feed our children. The luxury items such as TV, refrigerator and especially ACs emit a lot of harmful pollutants that affect our environment. To deal with this global environmental problem, different organizations including the BEE came up with an idea - to categorize consumer electronics products such as the ones named above into efficient and not efficient. 

To make the categorization easier for people to understand, BEE started marking the energy efficiency of electronic items using stars; one star being the lowest energy efficient and five stars being the highest energy efficiency. 

&amp;#x200B;

[3 Star ACs vs  5 Star ACS](https://preview.redd.it/0jb2vaq4ltr21.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a538658844ec41573efe549d8a4652460948bd62)

&amp;#x200B;

This star marking was to give consumers an idea of which AC is best for them. For example, if someone is planning to buy an AC, they had to make sure that they choose at least a 3-star AC. Though 5-star ACs are more recommended, 3-star ACs still do a fine job. Yet, when you are to choose either one of the two ACs, you can consider the cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pricing of the product is the first thing you consider if the quality quotient is equally high with all the options available in the market. So, when you are buying an AC and you are stuck with whether you should get a 3-Star AC or a 5-Star AC; you should base your decision on pricing. Now, needless to say, a [5-star AC](https://www.bajajfinserv.in/insights/3-star-acs-vs-5-star-acs--which-one-should-you-buy-this-summer) would be much more expensive compared to a 3-star AC since it is much more energy efficient. Here, you can either buy a less energy efficient product or increase your budget. You can also buy a 5-star AC on No-Cost EMI. 



No-Cost EMI plans are available with almost all Air Conditioners available online and offline in EMI stores. The process of buying ACs on No-Cost EMI is also very easy. While shopping online, you just have to add your EMI card in your preferred payment option and then pay using the card. While you are shopping for a product offline, you can let the sales representative help you with the purchase.",t2_2qkh2kjt,False,,0,False,Quick Comparison of 3 Star ACs vs 5 Star ACs: Which is more Efficient?,[],r/SavingMoney,False,6,,0,,False,t3_bccj3d,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1555097946.0,text,6,,,text,self.SavingMoney,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our earth is dying and our natural resources are depleting.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This star marking was to give consumers an idea of which AC is best for them. For example, if someone is planning to buy an AC, they had to make sure that they choose at least a 3-star AC. Though 5-star ACs are more recommended, 3-star ACs still do a fine job. Yet, when you are to choose either one of the two ACs, you can consider the cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing of the product is the first thing you consider if the quality quotient is equally high with all the options available in the market. So, when you are buying an AC and you are stuck with whether you should get a 3-Star AC or a 5-Star AC; you should base your decision on pricing. Now, needless to say, a &lt;a href=""https://www.bajajfinserv.in/insights/3-star-acs-vs-5-star-acs--which-one-should-you-buy-this-summer""&gt;5-star AC&lt;/a&gt; would be much more expensive compared to a 3-star AC since it is much more energy efficient. Here, you can either buy a less energy efficient product or increase your budget. You can also buy a 5-star AC on No-Cost EMI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No-Cost EMI plans are available with almost all Air Conditioners available online and offline in EMI stores. The process of buying ACs on No-Cost EMI is also very easy. While shopping online, you just have to add your EMI card in your preferred payment option and then pay using the card. While you are shopping for a product offline, you can let the sales representative help you with the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

,SavingMoney,"Longish story ahead 

So I’m planning this trip with my friends to go to Mexico during the summer, everyone’s paying for their own stuff and we like to check in every once in a while to see how much each one of us have saved up. They’re already have over $2,000 in their savings and I have a little over $900. My goal was to have at least $5000 to really wild out while I’m down there but as you can tell I’m really bad at saving up. I work in construction and get a weekly paycheck of $581 and some change if I don’t miss any days. We want to head over sometime in June or July. Is there a way I can save up to my goal without having to completely shut off myself from spending money or is that unrealistic?

,SavingMoney,"Survey finds American workers spend an average of $3000 a year on coffee and lunch at work. That is $90k in 30 years!!! Your lunch does not have to cost your health or to cost you a fortune. Invest in a reusable lunch bag!!! There is nothing wrong in carrying your meals in a brown paper bag or in a plastic grocery bag, but you can do much better! American workers spend an alarmingly high amount of their hard earned cash on somewhat average daily expenses, according to a new survey by Accounting Principals. The survey found that 50 percent of the American workforce spends approximately $1000 a year on coffee, or a weekly coffee habit of more than $20. And the spending doesn’t stop there. Two thirds (66 percent) of working Americans buy their lunch instead of packing it, costing them an average of $37 per week — nearly $2,000 a year. Despite these high costs, the survey suggests workers are unclear about the biggest drain to their wallet. When asked which work expense they most want to be reimbursed for by their employer, 42 percent of employees chose commuting costs and only 11 percent chose lunch expenses. However, the average American’s commuting cost is $123 a month or approximately $1500 a year, which is well below the average annual lunch tab of $2000. An insulated bag is reusable, easy to clean and keeps food at temperature especially. The beauty of insulated bags, aside from being reusable, is that they can keep hot food hot and cold food cold for longer than a plain old brown or plastic bag. Toss in an ice pack with your sandwich or leftovers, and if you work somewhere without a fridge or have a long commute your food will survive until lunchtime without spending too much time in the danger zone, where bacteria grow and make your food unsafe to eat. Similarly, insulated bags are easy to clean—just wipe them out with a paper towel and a little soap and water, and they're ready to hit the road again. In search for a good lunch bag, I’ve read a lot of reviews on amazon. What I found out is that many are complaining on annoying snagged or broken zippers and on plastic clips &amp; buckles that snap out.

,SavingMoney,"Throughout my time working at a New York based Private Equity firm, the angriest my boss (one of the Managing Partners at the firm) ever got at me had nothing to do with my job performance. Instead, he was disappointed with the steep rent price I was paying for my NYC studio. I explained to him it was the cheapest option within walking distance of the office. He immediately questioned me, “Did you negotiate the price?” I shook my head no. He responded with three words that have forever changed my perception, “Everything is negotiable”, then walked away.

I know he did not invent this quote, I had heard it before. However, I always attached “Everything is negotiable” to a used car salesman or Antique Roadshow, thinking it was just a corny sales line more than anything else. It was not until my Managing Partner, someone whom I deeply respect, recited this quote to me that I took it heart, and began to really analyze why “Everything is negotiable”.

**Why is “Everything is negotiable”**

The main reason “everything is negotiable” is because marketplaces are inherently inefficient. In a marketplace where a product is priced to maximize profits, a company forgoes potential profits on customers who are only willing to buy the product for a cheaper price. For example, picture the following conditions for a T-shirt company:

Cost of T-Shirt Production: $9.00

Number of Customers if T-Shirt Price is $20.00= 20 customers

Number of Customers if T-Shirt price is $10.00= 30 customers.

In this scenario, the T-shirt company company will make a larger profit listing its T-shirts for $20.00 ($220.00 profit), than $10.00 ($30.00 profit), and thus list the shirt for $20.00.

However, if the T-shirt company could *price discriminate* (charge different prices to different people based on their demand for the product), they would sell their T-shirts for $20.00 to the 20 customers ($11.00 profit per customer), then sell 10 shirts for $10.00 to the customers who are only willing to pay $10.00 for the shirt ($1.00 profit per customer). When price discriminating, as long as the company is making a profit (total revenue&gt; total cost), it always makes sense to sell a t-shirt at the price.

**Use Negotiation to Allow Price Discrimination:**

Two examples of price discrimination are age-based discounts (Senior Citizen or Children discounts) and time of week price cuts (gas stations will cut prices on specific week days, where only price sensitive customers will realize the discount). However, as you can likely tell, the problem with price discrimination is it's almost impossible to market. Both these examples capture some price discrimination, but do not come close to fully realizing potential discrimination. Thus, most companies will not price discriminate their products, and will find a single price that optimizes their profits.

The moral of the story is that companies *want* to price discriminate, but they are *unable* to. However, through effective negotiation, we (the customer) are able to expose the minimum price a company will be able to sell a product at. While in reality it is likely impossible to try to negotiate “everything” (I do not think you are going to be able to negotiate the price of a bag of Cheetos at a Walmart), there are many products you can negotiate which you may not have known are possible.

A few examples:

1. Hotel/ AirBnB prices: If a hotel is in off-season, or simply has excess rooms, they will likely be able to give you a discount. This is especially apparent during COVID, where the hospitality industry has been struggling. At the very least, you may be able to get some added benefit or a better room for the same price.
2. Media Subscriptions: Subscription based media companies (Netflix, Xfinity etc.) often charge a monthly postpay. However, they would prefer their users to prepay an annual subscription, as it guarantees customer retention and increases their cash flow immediately (to reinvest into the company). Thus, media providers will often provide a significant discount if you are willing to commit to an annual prepayment. The best part: you do NOT even have to negotiate. Third party platforms like Ubund will negotiate a 30%+ discount to your media subscription **for you** if you commit to a 1 or 2 year prepayment.
3. Furniture: Furniture showroom price is often much higher than its manufactured price. It is always worth attempting to negotiate on furniture before you purchase.
4. Gym Memberships
5. Electronics
6. Medical Bills

Tip for Negotiation: Increase Your Bargaining Power

Before you negotiate, always do your research to figure out how you can incentivize the seller to sell to you for less. Bullet 2 above is a great example of using research to increase bargaining power. These third party negotiation platforms understand that media companies prefer being paid upfront for a longer commitment, so they leverage the preference for an added discount for their customers. You can apply a similar negotiation tactic to anything you want a discount on. If you want a discount on a long-term stay on an Airbnb, explain to the Airbnb owner the benefits of your long term commitment (increased customer retention), then tell the owner you will only stay for an additional discount. Even if you do not have a bargaining angle, use the power of time. Tell the furniture salesperson that a couch you want is slightly over budget, but you are willing to purchase it immediately if provided a reasonable discount. Even if a negotiation attempt does not work, you will see over time that “negotiating everything” will consistently save you money.

,SavingMoney,"I'm always trying to think smart, and while everyone are going crazy for apps, referrals and such, I'll try to share something that will actually save you money - and possibly lots of them in the long run.

So why increasing your credit score should save you money? Well, having a better credit score will allow you to access more financing options at much better terms. For example, with FHA loans the down payment required varies in function of your credit score: the higher the credit score, the lower the down payment you will have to make and the lower the interest rates you will be charged (because you will be seen as a ""good borrower""). The capital that you won't have to put toward the down payment can be invested and grown and the smaller interest rate will save you quite a bit of money in the long run.

   When we try to think of ways we can save, most of us go through the same list of ways we can cut spending on non-essentials. For example, going out to eat less, drinking less or cheaper alcohol, turning off the heat and lowering utilities are all ways people change their lifestyle to save money. While cutting out non-essentials is a great habit to practice, I believe there is a better way to save money (without changing your lifestyle) that is often overlooked.  


   Saving on software. When people think to save, they rarely think of saving through software, and when they do, they think of cancelling their subscriptions. However, one can easily save on almost all software companies by using their bargaining power and prepaying. Today, almost all consumer oriented software companies (SaaS) will provide a monthly subscription option. While this option provides little commitment to the user, over time a monthly subscription will be more expensive than paying annually. This is because for software companies, cash now is always better than future cash (they can reinvest in the business and it guarantees customer retention). Therefore, unless you plan on only using a software for only a few months, it makes sense to prepay annually for your subscription.  


   How can you prepay annually? First, many software companies understand the power of annual prepayment, and will offer a flex option of the ability to subscribe monthly for one price or annually for a significant discount. However, what if the company only provides a monthly subscription (etc. Netflix, Xfinity)? There are third party platforms like [Ubund](https://ubund.co/?ubmid=56) which will leverage annual prepayment for you. Simply pay through the third party platform, and they will immediately provide you with a 30%+ discount for your prepayment. These third party platforms make money by acting as an added marketing source for softwares, so they do not cost you more than going through the software company themself.  


   Saving money has never been easy and never will be easy. Almost always one has to change their lifestyle negatively in order to stay. However, prepaying for software is one of the few ways one can save without changing their lifestyle at all!

There are many people who talk about how to live minimally and spend no money – that is not me. By the time I was ten I knew there were things in life I wanted – a house, a cottage and a sports car. That list has grown and evolved every year since. I could tell you that I don’t care about nice cars, or clothes, jewelry etc., but, I would be lying. I love nice stuff. It is not that I intentionally try to find expensive things to buy, it just seems to work out that way.

When I was growing up we did not have a lot of money. My parents worked hard and taught my Brother and Sister and I how to save and live within our means. Our first big lesson was: do not buy things you cannot afford. For a person who loves expensive stuff this was not a fun lesson, but, it is one I learned. We were told that if you cannot pay for it then you can’t have it. As a teenager I came to a quick realization – I needed to save where I could in order to get the things that I really want.

My saving strategy has never been to cut out things for a short period of time in order to save money. It is more about saving money daily in any way that I can. Since COVID I found saving money to be even easier than in the past. This article is going to focus on saving money by reducing the costs of the things you use every day (particularly if you are working from home due to COVID).

## How to Save Money

1. Use toll highways as seldom as possible and if you must use one make sure you have a transponder. In Ontario the cost to use the 407 ETR for 24 kilometers is $11.74 one way with a transponder and $15.94 without. If you are a toll road user and have started working remotely your savings per month would be $469.60 for transponder users.
2. Save your gas money. If you are now working at home, bank your gas money. This can create up to an additional $200.00 per month.
3. Make your coffee at home. If you skip your morning coffee out you can save an additional $40.00 per month.
4. Reach out to your Insurance company and request a reduction in your car insurance.
5. Do your laundry in off-peak hours which is 7:00-pm-7:00 am.
6. Try lowering your cell-phone charges.
7. Designate no spend days (you would be amazed how quickly the money adds up).
8. Make and stick to a grocery list.
9. Use coupons whenever you can.
10. Sign up for loyalty programs at all of the places you do business.
11. Do not buy books- borrow them from the library.
12. Save all of your change in a jar and do not touch it until the jar is full. Once it is full, roll your change and take it to the bank.
13. Do not pay any bank charges – switch to a bank with no fee accounts.
14. Use a programmable thermostat.
15. Turn off the tap when you are brushing your teeth.
16. Learn how to cook! If you rely on take out learning how to cook is a must.
17. Create a budget. It is important for you to know what your cost of living is. This is very important to know.
18. Work at paying off any high interest debt.
19. Consolidate your debt for a lower interest fee.
20. Get rid of cable (if you love cable request a lower package from your service provider.

If you do these 20 things you will be amazed at how quickly your savings will grow.

,SavingMoney,"Did you know that 60% of millennials cannot cover a $400 emergency!? For a nation riddled with debt, it is sad to see how many do not have an emergency fund. What is an emergency fund? It's a set amount of money you put aside with the sole purpose of bailing you out when s\*it hits the fan. And as you know, s\*it will always hit the fan. So why do so many people who know what the emergency fund is not have one? I think it's because many don't know where to start in creating one. I'm going to summarize some of the posts I've written to help anyone out there start building their emergency fund. For starters, your emergency fund should be between 3-6 months worth of expenses. I feel this should fluctuate based on your job, if you have a stable line of work then closer to 3 is probably good. If you are a freelancer and in and out of work, then 6 or more months is best for you. I certainly wouldn't go with less than 3. I know Dave Ramsey has people start with $1000, and I don't want to disagree with Dave but I have had two different instances with over $1000 emergencies. So how do you go about building your fund once you have a goal total in mind?

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you don't have an emergency fund then you need to get on a budget, or as I call it, a spending plan. This is the only way to free up money in order to start allocating it toward your goals. A real easy way to start saving money is to pay yourself first buy setting up automatic monthly transfers to your savings account. You simply determine how much you want to send to your savings account each month and make it a recurring payment. I have a [step by step guide here](https://walletdiagnostics.com/how-to-save-money-each-month/) for more information
2. It's smart to have your emergency fund completely separate from your checking account, as in you can't use a debit card to spend it. Most high-yield online banks allow simultaneous transfer of funds, so if an emergency comes up it takes only a few seconds to transfer the money. In addition, storing your fund at a high-yield savings account will earn you some extra interest.  [Here is an introduction](https://walletdiagnostics.com/high-yield-savings-accounts-a-guide-to-high-interest-savings/) to high-yield savings accounts for those interested.
3. You should know that emergencies happen even when building this fund. Do not get discouraged, if you have to dip into it then you continue on building it. With each dip into this fund you will be more thankful that you had it in the first place. My first $700 car emergency was the eye-opening experience I needed to understand how crucial always having this fund was. 
4. Know that it will take time to achieve your goal, but in the process you are also developing the habits required to build wealth. Once you have started tracking your spending to properly fund this account, you can now use those behaviors for other goals. Let's say that through budgeting you've been putting $200 per month to build your emergency fund. Once that fund is at your goal you now have that same $200 to put to a new goal. You've developed the skills and behaviors necessary to start building a true nest egg!

Hopefully these tips help inspire some of you to start building your emergency fund today. [Here is the original post](https://walletdiagnostics.com/emergency-fund-how-to-properly-build-yours/) where most of this was taken from.

,SavingMoney,"Hi there!

For as long as I can remember, I have lived paycheck to paycheck and then some. My credit card of about $1000 was maxed out way more often than it should have been, and I didn't really save.

For the past couple of months I've been putting aside some money, but only reducing costs reactively. It's been fun, but a real pain, easy to trick and hard to keep track of.

So now I've created one bank account for every expense I have (19 to be exact) and set up automatic fund transfers at pay day. Grocery money enters another account (grocery buffer), before being transferred to the grocery account every single day. (No more accidental over spending!)

I've also set up monthly transfers to an emergency fund, and to a car savings account!

I should have a surplus of 18% after everything is paid, which for the first month will cover bills I'm behind on and can be saved after that month.

,SavingMoney,"College is not cheap. Even after tuition payments, student loans, room and board and a meal plan, there are still many expenses for college students which add up over time. As a college student, despite prepaying for all of those expenses, I still always found myself spending significantly more than I budgeted for (unexpected take-out, various media subscriptions, deceivingly expensive textbook, alcohol etc.). By the end of all these expenses, I found myself virtually broke, with no money to spend on things I *truly* wanted at the time. 

While the easiest way to save more is to limit some of the impulsive spending I mentioned, I understand first hand as a college student that cutting impulse spending is extremely difficult. Oftentimes, when I try to actively cut out impulse purchases, I find myself giving in to a Doordash order (or equivalent) 3-4 days later. Simply put, impulse spending is something we enjoy as college students and makes us happy. Therefore, instead of trying to tell you to stop buying what you like, below are a few tips that will help you save money without cutting out the things you enjoy.

1. **Buy used books and resell**: Never buy brand new textbooks and never rent textbooks. Instead, buy the cheapest decent quality used textbook, keep it in good condition, and resell it once your semester ends. There are many textbook resell websites anyone can post on  (I cannot hyperlink on this page, but simply google “textbook resell websites”), or you can just resell the book to a college friend.  If you do your research, you can often make money through textbook arbitrage (reselling the textbook for more than you pay for it). 
2. **Get a time flexible job (Doordash/Uber):** Between class, studying, and extracurriculars, it can often be very difficult to find consistent time to work during school. However, for those who do have the occasional free time, working a time flexible job like Doordash or Uber is a great way to earn a couple of bucks quick. For Doordash (or an equivalent), you do not even need a car. Just bring your old bike from home up to school (or buy a used bike for cheap) and start delivering. Colleges have some of the highest demand for food delivery, so there will be no shortage of work and it can also double as a great workout.
3. **Prepay your subscriptions for a discount**: Whether it is your Netflix and Xfinity accounts, or even your online class subscription, find a way to prepay your subscription annually for an additional discount. Most companies will give a significant discount (30%+) if you commit to prepay for 1 or 2 years. If your desired subscription does not have a prepay option, there are third party platforms available that will prepay annually for you (and you will receive the same discount). 
4. **Passively Invest:** You do not need to be Warren Buffet or Ray Dalio to succeed in the market. In fact, you do not even need to know a thing about the markets, just invest in the market as a **whole**. Since the 1920s, the S&amp;P has averaged an annualized return of 10%. Compare this to your savings account which grows 1-2% or less a year, and the answer is obvious. Simply open a commission free brokerage account (like Robinhood), invest in an S&amp;P index fund (or equivalent), and increase your savings significantly.

When was the last time you wanted to order something but then decided not to because of the horrendous fees? Or even worse, you ordered something only to realize afterwards that a big part of the bill was just fees and taxes?

If this sounds familiar to you I have a few tips how to save money when ordering online:

\- look for special offers/promos/coupons: social media &amp; Google Search is your friend

\- sign up for a monthly pass: might be worth it if you order a lot

\- order more (&amp; share): order for more meals/people to share the fees

For the last point I created [this calculator](https://quarantify.com/#calculator) as well as a [web app](https://app.quarantify.com/) to help people save money by making ordering with neighbours easier. Any feedback would be much appreciated!

,SavingMoney,"Something I have always struggled with is budgeting. While after every paycheck I track how much money I spend on each expense (and think by doing so that I am budgeting and saving), I always feel myself short on cash and spending less at the end of each pay period. This habit I have created is because I am not *budgeting*, but I am *expense tracking.* 

Expense tracking is the act of noting every expense one incurs over a period of time and evaluating it based on your total savings. While expense tracking is a great way to determine how much of your savings have been allocated to certain expenses, it gives no projection of how to allocate your budget for **future** expenses. Through expense tracking, one is unable to properly weigh how they want to allocate their cash and savings over a period of time.

Expense tracking leads to short term lifestyle inflation, or the tendency to increase spending when their income increases. A personal example of lifestyle inflation is my relationship with food. Whenever I receive a paycheck (and my bank account seems bigger), my drive to cook seemingly decreases, and I begin to order take out significantly more than usual. A week and a half later, I will track my expenses, feel worse about my savings, and you will find me eating 89 cent canned chicken for 2 meals a day. While this tactic of expense tracking and momentary lifestyle inflation is one way of living life, most of us can agree that it is not our *ideal* lifestyle.

The key to living a consistent and well-balanced lifestyle is to budget. Successfully budgeting is to list out all of your future expenses at the beginning of each year, month, and even week. By budgeting, you can get a clearer picture of how much of your savings you are willing to allocate towards a variety of expenses (or investing). Instead of ordering take out 5 times in a row, and then eating cheaply and unhealthily for 2 weeks, budgeting allows me to spread out my take out days, and allows me to manage how I want to allocate spending on take-out and home cooked meals versus all other expenses. While budgeting may prevent you from experiencing the short-term euphoria of lifestyle inflation, in the long-term, budgeting will breed a more financially stable and ultimately happier lifestyle.

While budgeting is a necessity, it is not easy. Knowing just how much to spend in each expense category is extremely difficult and takes time to master. However, it is possible. Here are some tips I have to increase your spend predictability and to budget effectively.

1. Use a budgeting app: There are many budgeting apps which can help you list out your expenses and provide tips as to how to allocate your savings most efficiently.
2. Subscribe: Using monthly-subscription based services is a great way to predict your expenses. Whether it is a subscription meal box or a streaming app, subscriptions in any expense category give a clear picture of how much of your savings need to be allocated towards a particular expense. (To save money on subscriptions, I recommend you subscribe annually to all your subscriptions, or use a third party platform which will offer you an added discount for committing to prepaying a subscription annually).
3. Invest to Save: When budgeting, people often believe savings entails leaving a particular portion of their budget in a savings account (and earning 1-2% interest annually). By investing safely in index funds, mutual funds, or ETFs (which all require very little investing knowledge to use), anyone can easily earn 10%+ on their savings a year. Through investing, your budget will slowly begin to look bigger and bigger.

,SavingMoney,So I can’t save money if my life depended on it. I literally find a way to spend the last dime in my account.
